# Text Mining on Financial Technology News


## Introduction

Topic : Text Mining on Financial Technology News
, which is a **supervised learning** classification problem.

Using Pytorch deep-learning model with pre-train word-embedding method to predict future stock price prices of top 5 tech companies.

In real life, stock traders and investors make price prediction based on macro and micro events of the industry and company. Opinions and happenings in the news could reflect possible stock price fluctuation. Also, stock exchanging and news are all highly influenced by time. The sooner you hear news before the market, the better chance you have of getting in ahead of any price movements.
