3," By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Russia to pull its troops from Venezuela and warned that ""all options"" were open to make that happen. The arrival of two Russian air force planes carrying nearly 100 Russian troops outside Caracas on Saturday has escalated the political crisis in Venezuela. ""Russia has to get out,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, where he met with Guaido's wife, Fabiana Rosales. The U.S. government believes the Russian troops include special forces and cybersecurity personnel. Asked how he would make Russian forces leave, Trump said: ""We'll see. All options are open."" Russia has bilateral relations and agreements with Venezuela which it plans to honor, Russian Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said, in response to Trump's comments. ""It's not up to US to decide actions and fate of other countries. It's only up to the people of Venezuela and its only legitimate president Nicolas Maduro,"" Polyanskiy said on Twitter. Maduro, who retains control of state functions and the country's military, has said Guaido is a puppet of the United States. Rosales, a 26-year-old journalist and opposition activist, told Trump that Guaido was attacked on Tuesday, though she did not provide details. ""I fear for my husband's life,"" she said. She was accompanied by the wife and sister of Roberto Marrero, Guaido's chief of staff, who was arrested and detained last week. Earlier at the White House, Rosales met Vice President Mike Pence, and told him that power outages and food shortages were hurting children in her country. ""They are trying to break our morale. They want to submerge us in eternal darkness. But let me tell you that there is light, and the light is here,"" Rosales told Pence. She is slated to meet U.S. first lady Melania Trump in Palm Beach on Thursday on a swing through South Florida, home to the largest community of Venezuelan exiles in the United States. Rosales is also slated to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill and members of the Venezuelan diaspora at a prominent Washington think tank. Pence praised Rosales for being ""courageous.""",,"March 27, 2019, 11:49:00 AM EDT",Trump tells Russia to get its troops out of Venezuela

5," By Lawrence White LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Barclays  chief executive Jes Staley took direct control of its under-pressure investment bank on Wednesday, ousting the head of the business Tim Throsby in a surprise shake-up as he battles an activist investor. Staley is assuming oversight of the three Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) divisions, banking, markets and corporate bank, in a move he said would help improve overall returns to more than the 7 percent achieved in 2018. The Barclays CEO faces pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, who is seeking a seat on the board of the bank to try and force it to shrink the underperforming investment banking business that Staley has championed. A Barclays spokesman said Throsby's departure was ""not linked in any way"" to the pressure from Bramson's Sherborne investment vehicle, which holds a 5.5 percent stake in the bank. Barclays hired Throsby, who like Staley came from JP Morgan, in September 2016 after a six-month search for the vital job overseeing the bank's trading and advisory businesses. Throsby then made senior hirings as Barclays struggled to improve returns at the unit, which have consistently lagged its more profitable retail banking and credit card businesses. The return on tangible equity of 7 percent achieved by Barclays' investment bank in 2018 was a step up from the previous year, but still well short of its cost of capital and below the longer-term goal of 10 percent.

8," STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Reuters) - Telecoms equipment supplier Ericsson  is yet to see an increase in contract wins on the back of security concerns over China'sHuawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL], the Swedish company's chief executive said on Wednesday The mobile network gear maker counts market leader Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] and Finland'sNokia  as its main rivals and some analysts think it could benefit from Western suspicions of Huawei, after Washington alleged its gear could be used by Beijing for spying. Huawei has strongly rejected the allegations and launched a lawsuit against the U.S. government. ""And that of course leads to more discussions with customers for us, but we can't see that contracts are being allocated. That has not happened yet."" EU nations will be required to share data on 5G cybersecurity risks and produce measures to tackle them by the end of the year, the European Commission said on Tuesday, shunning U.S. calls to ban Huawei across the bloc.

10," By Naomi Tajitsu YOKOHAMA, Japan, March 27 (Reuters) - An external committee reviewing governance at Nissan Motor Co  said on Wednesday there were enough facts to suspect violations of laws and the private use of company funds by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn. Following a three-month audit of Nissan's governance after  a scandal that shook the global auto industry, the committee put the blame squarely on what it called Ghosn's concentration of power. It also acknowledged Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa's role in Ghosn's salary arrangement at the heart of the scandal. The group issued 38 recommendations to bolster Nissan's governance, including that top executive positions at the Japanese carmaker should not be held by people serving in executive positions at Renault or junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp. It also proposed that the majority of directors, including the chairman of the board, be independent, outside directors and that the role of company chairman be abolished. The recommendations from the external, seven-member committee come weeks after Nissan and Renault said they would retool their alliance, one of the world's biggest automakers, to break up the all-powerful chairmanship previously held by Ghosn. ""There are facts sufficient to suspect violations of laws and regulations, violation of internal rules and private use of company funds and expenses... by Mr. Ghosn,"" the committee said in its report. It also singled out Nissan director Greg Kelly, who too has  been indicted, for his alleged role in helping Ghosn avoid oversight, and said that Saikawa had signed documents regarding compensation Ghosn would receive after retirement. ""It is clear that there are issues requiring improvement with respect to Nissan's governance as it could not prevent the misconduct."" Ghosn, who this month was released on $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention centre, has called the charges against him ""meritless"". Kelly has also denied the charges. ""We expect Nissan will take these recommendations seriously and execute them in a swift manner to build the best possible governance structure,"" committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing in Yokohama. At the briefing, the committee declined to comment on whether other individual directors - including Saikawa - should be held for responsible for failing to prevent the alleged actions by Ghosn.  MERGER TALKS? Nishioka also told the briefing that the capital structure between Nissan and Renault was a matter for the companies, and it was not appropriate for the committee to get involved. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Renault intends to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months, after which it will set sight on a bid to buy Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The plans signal a return to the strategies supported by Ghosn, who held talks about merging Renault with Fiat Chrysler two to three years ago, the Financial Times, which cited sources familiar with the matter, adding the French government had opposed the move. Nissan has said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the most feted executives in the global auto industry who orchestrated Nissan's financial recovery in the early 2000s and created the blueprint for the automaking alliance between Nissan and Renault. At the time of his arrest in Tokyo in November on financial misconduct allegations, Ghosn held the chairmanship at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which together form one of the world's biggest automakers selling roughly 10 million vehicles each year, while also serving as Renault CEO. Nissan's board currently comprises nine directors including the chairman, three of whom are categorised as outside, independent directors. Two directors, including one outside director, formerly served senior vice president roles at Renault. In a statement, Nissan said that its board of directors would review the committee's proposals ""with the greatest attention as soon as possible"".

13,"Pixelworks ( PXLW ) operates with a fairly stable projector business, a growing video delivery business, and potentially a very meaningful mobile business. This article is an update to my original piece on Pixelworks which can be found here . The last time I wrote about Pixelworks, its mobile business was just a concept - namely, it had a mobile chip, but no customers. Since that time, the company has secured four customers for its Iris chips; HMD's Nokia, Xiaomi's Black Shark, ZTE, and Asus. Nokia is the customer that has the most potential currently. While an Iris chip is currently only in the 7.1 model, the companies have signed a strategic agreement where Pixelworks' chips will be incorporated into an increasing number of Nokia handsets. Nokia shipped 4.8 million smartphones in Q3 2018 and was the fastest growing manufacturer in that time period. If Pixelworks is able to be designed into 10 million Nokia phones annually at a $2 ASP, that would result in a $20 million incremental revenue stream for the company, huge relative to the $77 million in revenue the company did in 2018. Black Shark is a growing power in the gaming phone market, with volumes that are becoming more meaningful in each successive generation. The first model in early 2018 only shipped to China, but each successive model is being distributed to an increasing global footprint. ZTE was considered a high potential customer, but then, the US Justice Department clamped down on companies supplying ZTE, and even after that constraint was lifted, ZTE models have done poorly in the marketplace to the detriment of Pixelworks. Asus is a niche player without significant volumes to date. There are many more phone manufacturers in Pixelworks' pipeline, and the company's chips become more and more attractive with each successive generation (now on Iris Gen 5) as they shrink in size and use less power. The potential is there for this unit to show additional explosive growth with a design win with a high-volume manufacturer such as an Oppo or a Vivo. This week, Pixelworks announced a software license agreement with Qualcomm ( QCOM ) where a software version of Iris with limited functionality would be integrated with Qualcomm's application processor. This opens up a new potential market of customers who only need the limited functionality and wouldn't buy a physical Iris chip. This partnership is also very important because Qualcomm is working with Pixelworks rather than developing its own display processing technology, eliminating a prior overhang to the story. There are two potential growth avenues in this business unit. Pixelworks is currently selling into the Japanese market transcoding chips used in converter boxes and PVRs which allow customers to view 4K video on their TVs that were made before the new national standard was implemented. This business is growing quickly now and will probably grow for two to three years before maturing. The other opportunity is the OTA (Over the Air) market for cord cutters. Pixelworks' chips allow for the streaming of OTA content throughout the users' homes and even to their cellphones when away from home. This is a nascent market, but Pixelworks already has an important design win with Sling TV and is working on others. Projector This market continues to be fairly stable with one caveat. Last year, Pixelworks co-designed a chip for its largest projector customer, which it finished at the end of the year. On the negative side, this chip will have a lower ASP than the preceding generation but will be partially made up by a higher gross margin on these chips. This change will provide some headwind to the top line once these chips are rolled out, which could take a few years. From a valuation perspective, Pixelworks remains extremely inexpensive. Trading at an EV/Revenue multiple of 1.6x 2019E revenue, the company trades well below similar semiconductor companies with comparable gross margins. We expect multiple expansion to occur when mobile revenues begin to ramp and put fair value at 3x revenue or $6.65, representing 85% upside from current levels.

14,"Apple (AAPL) is no longer about iPhones, and while iPhone sales figures have stubbornly continued to shape investor sentiment, the plan was always a monumental shifting of gears to services, which promises to be much bigger than devices down the road. Now it’s about streaming, and it’s even about a new Apple Credit Card, both unveiled yesterday at a high-profile Apple event. The rule of thumb is that when Apple enters any space, everybody is watching. But this time, Apple’s debut into streaming isn’t about transforming the market—it’s about mission creep, and in some cases, it’s about playing catch-up (like it did with its  music  service, Apple Music). At a press event Monday afternoon, Apple management  announced  the fall launch of its paid, ad-free video portal for its own original movies and TV shows called  Apple TV+ . Apple has not yet revealed a price for it or said exactly how many shows it will have at launch  but some analyst estimates have  indicated  that it could be slightly more expensive than the cheapest Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video subscriptions, which are all around $8 per month. While Apple will reportedly spend some  $1 billion  on its own content, its streaming service is more of a Trojan Horse that will bring together a handful of existing services, including HBO, Starz, and Showtime as well. How has recruitment gone so far? So, so. The Apple TV app will support over 150 streaming apps, including Amazon Prime and Hulu, as well as DIRECTV NOW and PlayStation Vue. But  Netflix  isn’t playing ball. In 2006, Apple was actually one of the  first  to offer paid-for videos on its iTunes, but then things stalled, and now it’s entering an already-crowded streaming market. Netflix, meanwhile, has more than 148 million  subscribers  globally, followed by  Amazon  with more than 100 million people subscribed to its Prime service. Other streaming services such as Hulu are relatively small by comparison, but even they have some 25 million  subscribers  in the U.S. Most recently,  NBC  announced its own streaming service, which could launch as early as May. Disney  and Warner Media are also due to launch streaming platforms later this year. And just last week, Disney concluded a $71.3-billion  mega-merger  with Century Fox. The big question is whether Apple lagged behind on purpose. After all, one of the most annoying aspects of all the streaming services is that customers have to have multiple accounts to watch everything they want. They’ve been waiting for someone to come in and bring it all under a single umbrella. Will that be Apple? Well, not yet—and not without Netflix. But it’s worth keeping in mind that even though competition is strong and established, Apple has an extremely  loyal  customer base. Also, while Apple it is hoping to attract some of its competitors' subscribers, there are millions of newcomers in the form of ex-cable users. The Wall Street Journal recently  reported  that more than three million customers in the US canceled their cable TV or satellite subscriptions in the last quarter of 2018, making that a total of 10 million since 2010. Apple Music, iTunes, and the App Store already make up almost 15 percent of the tech giant's  annual  revenues — some $37.2 billion in 2018. Apple has reportedly set a target of 100 million subscribers to its streaming service in the first five years. That could add $7 billion to $10 billion to its annual revenues. Aside from streaming, Apple also  announced it was overhauling its news app, called  Apple News+.  The app is adding more than 300 magazine subscriptions for a monthly subscription price of $9.99.  The New York Times and the Washington Post, which have higher-priced  monthly subscription programs, reportedly will not be part of the service. And there’s more, still: The tech giant has also introduced its own credit card, Apple Card , which will come out this summer and will be linked to Goldman Sachs. It will feature both a digital version for Apple devices and a physical card for when Apply Pay isn’t accepted. All of this may not seem enormously disruptive, but Trojan Horses aren’t immediately obvious, as history has demonstrated.

15," SHANGHAI, March 27 (Reuters) - Chinese regulators are urging brokerages to pay strong attention to risks in their bond repurchase, or repo, businesses, after some borrowers failed to answer margin calls, two sources said on Wednesday. Ten institutions which borrow money using bonds as collateral in the repo business failed to increase deposits after margin calls were triggered, prompting five brokerages to use 242 million yuan ($36 million) worth of their own money to plug the hole, according the China Securities Investor Protection Fund Corp, supervised by China's securities watchdog. The Investor Protection fund warned that risks from frequent bond defaults could spread to the bond repo business, according to the source. Chinese regulators have issued a flurry of warnings in recent months over an apparent resurgence in riskier types of financial activity, as policymakers shift their focus from a debt clampdown to boosting the slowing economy. China's securities regulator announced measures on Monday to restrict convertible bond subscriptions after surging demand for the instruments, prompted by this year's stock market rally, raised concerns over market liquidity.

16," By Tom Sims FRANKFURT, March 27 (Reuters) - Commerzbank's  chief executive was paid 32 percent less in 2018, contrasting with sharp rises for the top management at its potential merger partner Deutsche Bank. The disparity, revealed in Commerzbank's annual report on Wednesday, underscores a divide in the compensation culture of the German banking rivals, which are in talks over a merger. Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke's total compensation for the year was 1.97 million euros  ($2.22 million), down from 2.88 million euros in 2017, compared with 7 million euros for Deutsche Bank's chief Christian Sewing. And pay for Commerzbank's management board dropped by 24 percent in 2018, while Deutsche Bank's board received total pay, including bonuses, of 55.7 million euros, up from 29.8 million euros a year earlier. Commerzbank, 15 percent owned by the government after a bailout a decade ago, focuses on individual retail customers and financing small-and-medium sized corporate clients. Deutsche Bank in contrast operates a sprawling global investment bank. The drop in management pay at Commerzbank comes despite its net profit rising to 865 million euros from 128 million a year earlier, although it scaled back revenue targets. Commerzbank's annual profit was more than twice the 341 million euros earned by Deutsche Bank. Commerzbank's bonus pool for the broader workforce declined 41 percent to 134 million euros from 229 million a year earlier. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment.  TOO SMALL TO SCALE? Separately, Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner said that the banks aim to announce more concrete steps on the merger by late April. Achleitner, speaking at a conference in Liechtenstein, said that a merger makes great sense from a macroeconomic perspective, but that the banks were still studying the operational value. ""Our problem may not be too big to fail, but rather too small to scale,"" Achleitner said. ""Size matters."" The prospect of a merger is facing heightened opposition from Commerzbank employees. The bank's workers' council sent a letter to board members on Wednesday to protest the merger, saying the idea lacked support among workers, customers and society. ""We are of the opinion that you will fall into an uncontrollable adventure without a solid plan, without a vision and without support,"" the letter said.",,"March 27, 2019, 07:01:00 AM EDT",Commerzbank management pay cuts contrast with Deutsche Bank
17," By Elizabeth Dilts and Anna Irrera NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's  credit card deal with Apple Inc  is the latest move by the Wall Street investment bank to court mass-market consumers, potentially connecting Goldman with hundreds of millions of iPhone users. But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank's fledgling consumer business through credit card lending. Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday. But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets. ""As this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,"" said a person involved in similar credit card deals. Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for  cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said. Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a ""major step"" in the bank's plan to grow its consumer business. Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank's strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading. But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon's email. While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank's overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt. ""People want Goldman to be Goldman,"" Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article. The Apple Card's wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books. ""They might securitize the debt, which wouldn't be anything new for an investment bank,"" Siegel said. ""I can't imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt."" As this is Goldman's first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named. The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take. Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman's decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world's biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share. While Apple says its card is ""created by Apple, not a bank,"" according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card. ""For Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,"" said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.",,"March 27, 2019, 07:00:00 AM EDT",Goldman's Apple pairing furthers bank's mass-market ambitions
18," By Karen Pierog CHICAGO, March 26 (Reuters) - Yield-hungry investors on Tuesday snapped up more than $1.1 billion of general obligation bonds offered by Illinois and Chicago, two of the U.S. municipal market's most financially troubled issuers. While the state and its largest city continued to pay a high price for their fiscal woes, their deals benefited from low supply in the $3.8 trillion market and ""a ton of cash"" looking for bonds to buy, according to Greg Saulnier, a Municipal Market Data (MMD) analyst. Shaun Burgess, a portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors,  agreed. ""Clearly, demand is discounting some of the credit risks associated with these issuers,"" he said. MMD narrowed so-called credit spreads for Illinois, the lowest-rated U.S. state, at a notch or two above junk, due to its huge unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit, in the wake of a $440 million bond sale. The state's spreads remain the widest among U.S. states. Chicago, which is also struggling with pension funding and deficits, increased the size of its bond offering to nearly $728 million and moved pricing up by a day. There was enough demand to allow underwriters to lower yields by 5 basis points in most maturities through a repricing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch beat out eight other bidders for Illinois'$300 million of taxable bonds and 13 other bidders for $140 million of tax-exempt bonds, according to the state. Yields on the tax-free refunding bonds topped out at 3.60 percent in 2028 with a 5 percent coupon. MMD narrowed Illinois spreads over its scale by 1 to 10 basis points with the spread for bonds due in 2028 shrinking 1 basis point to 182. The refunding also resulted in a $10.6 million present value savings, the state reported. Yields reached 6 percent in 2044 for Illinois' taxable bonds. Proceeds from that deal will help fund a pension benefit buyback program the state launched last year. Neene Jenkins, a vice president and municipal credit analyst at AllianceBernstein, said the bonds were priced much tighter than where the city's bonds had been trading in the secondary market. She added, however, that Tuesday's pricing ""is reflective of a credit that is in distress.""",,"March 27, 2019, 07:00:00 AM EDT",Investors grab hefty yields in Illinois and Chicago bond sales

20,"The technology sector is littered with emerging themes and corresponding exchange traded funds (ETFs) that offer tactical investors compelling long-term potential. A prime example of a booming theme buoyed by favorable fundamentals is cloud computing, which is accessible in basket form via the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY). The $2.09 billion SKYY turns eight years old in July and tracks the cap-weighted ISE Cloud Computing Index. While cloud computing has been receiving increased attention in recent years, it is still a relatively new industry group within the broader technology sector. Said another way, cloud computing as an industry is not as old as, say, semiconductors or traditional software. As such, there are some qualifiers that are part of SKYY's underlying index. For instance, the index allows for the inclusion of three types of companies: dedicated cloud providers, non-pure play cloud companies and technology conglomerates. An example of a dedicated cloud company would be VMware (VMW), SKYY's second-largest holding; while an example of a non-dedicated company with some cloud exposure would be Facebook (FB), SKYY's sixth-largest holding. A technology conglomerate would be a company such as IBM (IBM), which is also a SKYY constituent. SKYY conglomerate exposure is defined as follows: “technology Conglomerate Cloud Computing Companies: Large broad-based companies that indirectly utilize or support the use of cloud computing technology.” The fund's index caps exposure to those companies at 10%. The Cloud = Growth Going beyond the mechanics of SKYY, the growth trajectory of the cloud business is what sets the table for this ETF. “The worldwide public cloud services market is projected to grow 17.3 percent in 2019 to total $206.2 billion, up from $175.8 billion in 2018,” according to Gartner, Inc. Cloud application software, also known as software as a service or SaaS, underpins the growth of cloud computing, but other corners of the market are emerging as credible revenue drivers. “The fastest-growing segment of the market is cloud system infrastructure services (infrastructure as a service or IaaS), which is forecast to grow 27.6 percent in 2019 to reach $39.5 billion, up from $31 billion in 2018,” said Gartner.  Courtesy: Gartner, Inc. Cloud-related investment opportunities are spread across multiple corners of the communication services and technology sectors. SKYY reflects as much as the cloud ETF features exposure to 27 stocks from eight industry groups. Underscoring the point that the cloud is big business for big technology companies, the median market capitalization of SKYY's holdings is $49.13 billion. A prime example of a mega-cap technology company with significant cloud exposure is Microsoft (MSFT), which is a 2.41% weight in SKYY. ""We estimate Azure (Microsoft’s cloud business) is approximately a $7 billion business and it still grew by a staggering 76% year over year in the December quarter,” said Morningstarin a recent note. “The battle for cloud supremacy has become a two-horse race between Azure and AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Azure is well-positioned given its installed base at enterprise customers with Server, Database, Dynamics, and Office. Enterprise clients are increasingly adopting a hybrid cloud environment, which plays into Microsoft’s strong position, as the company can offer customers their existing environment in either public cloud or on premise flavors.” Bottom Line Past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but over the past three years, SKYY has easily outperformed broader, traditional technology indexes and ETFs with less annualized volatility. Bolstering the long-term case for cloud stocks and SKYY is cloud computing's intersection with an array of disruptive, emerging technologies, such artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and healthcare innovation.",Todd Shriber,"March 26, 2019, 03:29:33 PM EDT",An ETF With Sky-High Potential

24,"Shutterstock photo I have frequently, right here in these pages, pointed out that traders’ knee-jerk reactions to news and events can result in opportunities for investors of a more patient, thoughtful bent. The market’s immediate response to events is often more about expectations and positioning going into it than it is about the actual substance of an announcement, and that seemed to be the case yesterday as Apple (AAPL) revealed their suite of new services. The company announced three new subscription services, Apple TV+, Apple News+, and a new Apple Card. Traders’ disappointment presumably stems from the fact that two of the “new” services simply added a “+” to the names of existing ones. That is understandable in some ways but doesn’t really explain the roughly two percent drop in the stock that followed. After all, expanding existing services into revenue producing models is a relatively cheap way of finding out if previously free offerings can actually add to the bottom line and won’t have any noticeable impact on overall profitability for a while. Still, this was an Apple event and traders a have become accustomed to those producing exciting, ground-breaking innovations. When none of those came, they hit the sell button.  Analysts, on the other hand, generally saw this as what it is: a low-cost exploration of potential new revenue streams. Not that you would know that from some of the headlines. CNBC’s article on the reaction was headlined Wall Street calls Apple event a dud: 'Expect the focus to return to the slowing iPhone business'. That includes a quote from one analyst but read further down and you see that the reactions overall were that the event was anything but “a dud.” The quote was from the analyst at Goldman, whose take was indeed somewhat negative, but the other responses quoted fell into two camps. There were those, like Morgan Stanley and Piper Jaffrey, who raised the stock’s target price, and others, like Bank of America, who basically said that without pricing information it was impossible to assess the impact. I guess that an honest headline about a mixed but slightly positive reaction just wouldn’t have drawn enough clicks. That shows the dangers of reading only headlines, but the real question is what all this means for investors, and the answer to that can be found in history. Put simply, when a giant, cash-rich tech company attempts to branch out to find new revenue sources, there is always a chance of a long-term positive impact on the stock, but even if the attempt fails, it rarely prompts a big decline. A good example would be Google (GOOG: GOOGL)’s various attempts at social media platforms. Google Buzz lasted a year from 2010 to 2011, Friend Connect four years from 2008-12 and, most recently, Google Plus, launched in 2011 was shut down. None of those could be called a resounding success, but as they have unfolded, Google’s stock has gained around 750%. Of course, you could argue that it would have gone up more without them, but the willingness to branch out has also resulted in the company diversifying into other areas that have proven to be winners. The same could be said for Apple. They are no longer just a hardware company. A significant portion of their revenue now comes from various services businesses and that looks set to continue growing, regardless of how these particular services do. Selling AAPL on this latest announcement makes sense for those who had bought it in the belief that the event would be something it wasn’t. For the rest of us though, selling now means betting against the long-term prospects of one of the most successful companies on the planet. That just doesn’t look like a bet that it would be wise to take.",Martin Tillier,"March 26, 2019, 09:48:51 AM EDT",Why AAPL's Drop on Yesterday's Event Shouldn't Matter to Investors

26,"Tim Cook at Apple's keynote event Apple’s (AAPL) transition into a fully-fledged services company took a major leap Monday when the company announced a slew of new services offerings at its Cupertino campus. ""Today's going to be a very different kind of event,"" CEO Tim Cook said at the outset. The company, which brought major star power to Monday’s event, including Oprah Winfrey and directors Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams, has been transitioning more towards its service capabilities as a means to offset slower iPhone sales. Apple didn’t disappoint, unveiling of the company's premium streaming video service called Apple TV+, which many observers perceive as an attack on Netflix (NFLX). The company also announced a new Apple TV app feature called Channels, which allows users an easy way to subscribe to third-party services like HBO and Showtime. The company said the new feature will be made available on Apple devices and soon on smart TVs from Samsung, LG, among others. The app also will be available on Roku (ROKU) and Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV devices. Prior to the event, I took a stab at what the tech giant was likely to reveal. I got two things right. In addition to the premium video service, which Apple said would be available in 100+ countries in the fall, Apple also unveiled a subscription news service called Apple News Plus, which curates news for each user in a section called ""news for you.” The service will cost $9.99 per month. ""This is going to take Apple News to a whole new level,"" Cook said of News Plus. The news platform, which is currently accessible as an app on Apple devices, will be revamped to included some 300 magazine publishers, including Sports Illustrated, National Geographic, Fortune and the New Yorker. The service will feature prominent newspapers such as the L.A. Times and the Wall Street Journal. Much of this was anticipated and highly discussed prior to the event. What was a surprise to investors and analysts, however, was the company’s unveiling of a gaming platform as well as its own credit card. The Apple card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs (GS), is designed specifically for iPhone users and is tied to Apple Pay and the Apple Wallet. Like most credit card companies, Apple is also offering perks. One of which is called Daily Cash, which it will credit to users daily. This includes rebates for purchases such as 3% for items purchased from Apple, 2% for items purchased using Apple Pay and 1% for every other purchase. What’s more, as with the company’s stance on privacy, Apple says it will not use customer data such as tracking what the customer buys, where they spend their money, and how much they pay. The company says Goldman Sachs will also be restricted from tracking customer data. Although the card is tied to each iPhone, customers can also request a physical card, which Apple says will contain no card number, CVV, expiration date, or signature. The physical card, which will be available starting in the summer, will be made of titanium and will contain the customer’s name, which will be laser-etched. Finally, Apple took a bite out of the $140 billion gaming industry by introducing Apple Arcade — a subscription gaming service that will feature 100 new games exclusive solely to Apple. The gaming services will be available as an app in the app store, allows users to start a game on one Apple device and continue it on another. Without announcing a pricing plan, the company says Arcade will be available in the fall of 2019. The overall grade of everything Apple announced Monday will take more time to assess.

27," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nintendo (OTCMKTS: NTDOY ) had a record holiday quarter for sales of its Switch game console, but that still wasn't enough to meet its yearly sales target.  Adding to the company's woes, sales of its low-cost 3DS handheld are falling even faster than expected. Things will get even tougher this year, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) expected to release a lower cost, disc-free Xbox One and Alphabet  (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) launching its Stadia streaming game service that can deliver AAA games to mobile devices. In response to these challenges, the company is reportedly working on two new Nintendo Switch models: a low-cost version and a higher-end model. With Nintendo stock down 36% from this time last year, and the Switch now two years old, the company clearly feels it needs to make some big moves in 2019. Going back to last fall, slowing Switch momentum was hitting Nintendo stock as investors got nervous. Even after delivering its best Q2 in eight years , NTDOY took a hit over concerns that the Switch wasn't going to sell in the numbers Nintendo was aiming for. Then the first rumors that a new Nintendo Switch was in the works began in the fall of 2018. The Wall Street Journal reported that Nintendo had plans for a new model of its handheld hybrid console planned for release this summer, with the LCD display expected to get an update. After that initial speculation, rumors began to grow that there was indeed a new Nintendo Switch coming in 2019, but that it would be a lower cost, "" stripped-down "" version of the current console. Today, The Wall Street Journa l came out with a new report on NTDOY's hardware plans . This time, the newspaper's sources say both rumors are true: Nintendo is actually working on two new Switch consoles, a low-cost version, and a new higher-end model. The strategy of releasing a pair of new Nintendo Switch models could solve multiple problems Nintendo faces in 2019. The low-cost version, which is reported to ditch a few features like the controller's rumble capability, with a focus on portability, could be the successor to the 3DS. Nintendo's lower cost portable is now eight years old, and its sales are declining more quickly than the company anticipated. A low-cost Switch (which would still be compatible with all Switch games) would take over from the 3DS and appeal to gamers who couldn't afford the current Switch. This budget-friendly version could also convince owners of other consoles to pick up a cheap Switch as well, for portable gaming.  The increase in overall Switch units would also help to keep third-party game developers interested in the platform. A higher-end version of the Switch would include an improved LCD display and a new processor. According to the WSJ report, Nintendo is targeting gamers who lean toward the Xbox One X or PS4 Pro (although the new Nintendo Switch would not be as powerful as those consoles). It is also likely to trigger an upgrade cycle among current Switch owners who want the improved hardware. The company is expected to follow the same approach Microsoft and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) took with their upgraded consoles, ensuring games are playable on all console versions, but offering enhanced graphics performance on the higher-end model. Last year, Nintendo tried keeping the Switch's momentum going with Labo cardboard building kits and the release of several big games, primarily Super Smash Bros . While that led to some record-setting quarters, including a holiday sales quarter where the company moved 9.4 million units (up 30% from the previous year), NTDOY still had to revise its full-year sales of the console down. After two years on the market, offering two new Nintendo Switch models - one for price-conscious shoppers and one to tempt hardcore gamers - may be the answer to kickstarting sales. And the move may just help Nintendo stock recover from the past year's losses. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

34,"Shutterstock photo There has been tons of speculation as to what Apple (AAPL) may announce at its event — dubbed ""It's showtime” — which will be held on March 25 at the Steve Jobs Theater on its Apple Park campus. Chief among the rumored unveiling is the likelihood that the tech giant will unveil a new services offering, which is widely expected to include a video subscription service and a news subscription. The latter has been touted by analysts as the Netflix (NFLX) for news service. Reports suggest that publishers needed tons of persuading from Apple to agree to a revenue share model, where Apple plans to keep about 50% of subscription revenue, according to WSJ sources. Needless to say, this is an important event, particularly for investors and analysts who have been obsessed about the need for Apple to diversify its business away from iPhones. Apple shares closed Friday at $191.05. The shares, which received three analyst upgrades on Thursday, are up 21% year to date and have risen 27% over the past three months, besting the 10% year-to-date rise in the S&P; 500 index. One of the upgrades on Thursday came from Laura Martin, analyst at Needham, who assigned the stock with a Strong Buy rating. ""On Monday, Apple will announce a new content service that, IF adopted by its users, should lower churn and drive higher lifetime value for each of Apple's 900 million unique ecosystem users,” Martin said. Adding, “Additionally, it might attract new users to Apple's ecosystem.” Aside from the widely-expected new services bundle, Apple is also rumored to debut a stand-alone video streaming service as well, according to the Information, which earlier this year noted that Apple was in negotiations with studios and networks, advising them to be prepared for an April launch. Bloomberg reported last week that Apple had reached out to AT&T; (T), parent company of HBO as well as CBS Corp (CBS), which owns Showtime, in its rush to assemble a catalog of film and television for said subscription service. It is not known how far these conversations (or negotiations) have gotten. And there are no clear details as to whether Apple would bundle the news service along with the streaming service, or if they will be offered separately. What we do know is the company has long had ambitions to enter this space and has signed a number of production or development agreements with both producers and Hollywood actors. This is in addition to the company last year announcing a multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey. It remains to be seen whether any of these rumors are correct. What is clear is that, based on both confirmed and unconfirmed reports, Apple’s streaming service catalog will contain a mix of content that is either funded by Apple as well as those owned by major studios which it will license. As for the news subscription service unveiling, which is said to be priced at monthly rate of $10, this one is not so clear cut. Reports suggests Apple would aggregate news and magazine subscriptions into one product. I’m curious to know what else will the subscription provide, given that some publishers such as The Washington Post and New York Times are hesitant to sign up due to the terms of the proposed revenue share agreement. All that said, the good news is that the company is looking to diversify its business, which bodes well for its long-term prospects.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 25, 2019, 08:04:33 AM EDT",Apple's (AAPL) March 25 Event: What to Expect

Abrams, with the latter     to star Jennifer Garner; drama ""Are You Sleeping"" starring Octavia Spencer; an adaptation of the book ""Defending Jacob"" starring and     executive produced by Chris Evans; a based-on-a-true story CIA     drama starring ""Captain Marvel's"" Brie Larson; and a video-game development studio comedy from ""It's     Always Sunny in Philadelphia's"" Rob McElhenney and Charlie     Day.  And that's just for starters. Nearly two years after Apple   recruited former Sony TV presidents Zack Van Amburg and Jamie   Erlicht, not a single frame of footage from any of Apple's shows   has been publicly released. One aspect of Apple's subscription   television product that has been confirmed is that the company   will not only distribute its own shows but also seeks to be a   gateway to selling third-party video subscription services like   Starz and Showtime, for a healthy fee. It remains to be seen if   AT&T's HBO will be an Apple partner. Netflix disclosed last   week that it will not be on the platform.

Finally, Amazon has made it dead-simple to   subscribe to new channels directly from its Fire TV devices, with   nothing more than your TV remote. All of that has helped the company to turn Channels into the   biggest marketplace for standalone video subscription services   since its launch in late 2015, with The Diffusion Group   estimating a year ago that Amazon was singlehandedly responsible   for   55% of all standalone video subscriptions    .

40," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Largely driven by hopes and dreams for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) upcoming streaming offering, Apple stock has rallied in recent weeks. In fact, so far in 2019, Apple stock is up over 24%.  But these hopes seem to be misplaced. For a variety of reasons, ranging from a  lack of access to many consumers' TVs to a lack of first-mover advantage to a lack of demand for what AAPL reportedly plans to offer, Apple streaming almost definitely won't move the needle for Apple stock. Therefore, I believe that investors should sell Apple stock ahead of the event, which is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET on March 25. Here are the top five reasons (in no particular order) why the streaming product is very unlikely to move the needle for Apple  stock. I've written about the tremendous competition in the sector streaming before in reference to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) stock , but it's  worth repeating here, since AAPL is about to enter the same space. In a column published by InvestorPlace on Feb 8, I wrote: ""The price hike isn't going to help Netflix's battle against its emerging competitors in the streaming space. Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN+, which recently announced that it has 2 million subscribers, Dish's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling TV, which had 2.4 million  subscribers as of November 2018 , Hulu, with  25 million subscribers , YouTubeTV,  Roku  (NASDAQ: ROKU ), and Plex are among the other services competing for streaming TV dollars."" Additionally, later this year, DIS will introduce its own entertainment streaming service, Disney+, and only in the last week , I've discovered a new, free streaming service, Pluto TV , which looks pretty robust. Also, first-mover advantage, i.e. the advantage that the first major product in a category has, is often tremendous.  Think of Netflix in video streaming, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in e-commerce, and the iPod from Apple. All of the efforts to introduce competition to those initial products did not unseat them. In video streaming, AAPL will not even be the second, third, or even fourth mover. AAPL did make a deal with Samsung to offer the Apple streaming app on all Samsung TVs. Still, it turns out Samsung TVs have a market share of only 33% in the U.S. smart TV market. Meanwhile,  anyone with an Apple device will reportedly get Apple streaming for free , so AAAPL won't get any subscription revenue from its own massive installed base. That presumably includes the owners of Apple TV devices, which had a whopping 15% share of the U.S. market as of the middle of last year. Had AAPL followed my advice and bought Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) in addition to making the deal with Samsung, it would have had access to many more consumers. It also might have been able to make a tremendous amount of money from selling ads. Roku has estimated that a quarter of all TVs in the U.S. had Roku pre-installed, and Roku apparently does not come pre-installed on Samsung TVs. Plus, in August, 27% of Americans who used a device other than a smart TV to watch stream in television utilized Roku, a survey by research firm William Blair found.  Due to the popularity and high prices of Apple's iPhone, it's not easy to meaningfully improve Apple's financial results with other items. Consequently, it's very difficult for Tim Cook and his staff to move the needle for Apple stock. It looks like even if Apple streaming is wildly successful, it won't meaningfully impact Apple's financial results for some time. Specifically, last month Jefferies analyst Tim O'Shea calculated that, even if 250 million people sign up for the streaming service, ""it still would account for only about 5% of the company's revenue that year - and wouldn't make up for its declining smartphone sales,"" Boy Genius quoted Business Insider as reporting. As a result of Netflix's low prices and the ever-increasing competition, AAPL can't charge high prices for its service.  O'Shea estimated that it would only charge $15 per month for it. If the report about Apple streaming being free for owners of the company's devices is correct, it will really limit the products ability to move the needle for Apple stock. It appears that AAPL hopes that it can make Apple streaming lucrative by using it to sell subscriptions to bundled, paid channels. AAPL will reportedly keep 30% of the revenue from these deals. And, importantly, unlike Amazon, Apple will be able to sell the bundled channels for less than they would cost if consumers had bought them individually. But there are a number of flaws with this plan. Many people already have plenty of content from Netflix and Amazon. Many more have Hulu or Sling. And now Apple is presumably going to offer free content to the owners of Apple devices. First of all, how much content do people need? Secondly, the whole point of cord cutting is to save money. If consumers are paying for Netflix and, say, Hulu, and then add one of Apple bundles and Disney+ for their kids, they're not going to save any money by cutting the cord. For the same amount of money, they could probably have an expensive cable package with TiVo. And that leads me to my next point; many of the people who have enough money to buy Apple's bundles probably already have old-fashioned things called premium cable channels and TiVo. About the only audience that Apple's bundles could have tremendous appeal for are wealthy people living abroad who love American content. But that's a limited audience, and Netflix and Amazon are already filling that niche. Apple is apparently betting that signing big names, such as Oprah and Steve Carell, to make content for Apple streaming will put it heads and shoulders above the competition. But history shows that big names don't always, or even usually, create big hits or even beat the competition. For instance, was Oprah's OWN cable channel a tremendous hit? Can you even name any of Carrell's  projects since he left The Office ? Amazon thought it could guarantee hit films by hiring Woody Allen to write them. That didn't work out too well for Jeff Bezos and crew. And even if the content isn't vastly superior, maybe Apple streaming could beat the tremendous competition in the sector if its product had some huge technical edge. But technical innovation has not been a hallmark of AAPL under Cook. Moreover, a large number of reports about the project have emerged, and none of them seems to discuss technology. Therefore, that scenario seems unlikely to play out. For all of the reasons outlined above, Apple streaming does not seem well-positioned to be the savior of Apple stock. Moreover, Apple's crown jewel, the iPhone, is still in trouble, and AAPL is facing threats on other fronts, such as the possibility that content creators will stop paying the App Store's ""Apple tax."" Therefore, I recommend selling Apple stock now. As of this writing, the author did not own stock in any of the aforementioned companies.

42,"Shutterstock photo By Katherine Noall, CEO of Sphere Identity, a global identity blockchain-based platform for identity storage and on-boarding. Identity verification poses a significant challenge to businesses in the E-Commerce industry and beyond. Ensuring customers are who they say they are, otherwise known as Know Your Customer (KYC), is the only way to run an efficient business that limits fraud and complies with anti-money laundering regulations. In the same vein, storing vast amounts of consumer data is not only an ethical grey area depending on how that data is used, but also creates centralized databases, or honeypots, which are attractive targets for hackers. Over the past several years as blockchain technology has begun to seep into mainstream consciousness, much has been done behind the scenes to incorporate its trustless, transparent characteristics to tackle these challenges from both sides, for both businesses and customers. When KYC is required for the customer in the E-Commerce space, it typically involves typing information such as names, contact numbers, and email addresses, in addition to uploading documents, such as driver’s licenses and passports. However, storing vast amounts of consumer data is not only an ethical grey area depending on how that data is used, but the information and documents customers must provide are also generally unencrypted, making them easily interceptable. The information is then centrally stored and a database, or honeypot, is created, leaving an attractive paper trail for hackers and other bad actors. As it stands, the customer journey is designed to improve the user experience for sign-ups, breaking down the process into a series of pages. This might make it look less daunting on the surface, but instead causes increased onboarding fatigue for customers who have to endure page after page of form filling. Research has shown that 22% of online abandonment is caused by customers balking at online forms, and this trend further adds to this figure. E-commerce businesses that continue to use online forms — whether on one page or segregated across many, are leaving revenue and opportunities on the table. Enter blockchain technology. The use of blockchain for KYC positively impacts time, money and other resources required for on-boarding. Applying blockchain technology causes KYC automation to be highly scalable and more secure. Scalable, because it is inherently global; secure, because the technology is tamper-resistant and has inbuilt security, including encryption and time stamping. This makes the distributed, encrypted storage of identity documents and data possible, and with this, identity honeypots will reduce as the industry matures. In time, these honeypots with be replaced with improved mechanisms for self-sovereign identity. The beauty of self-sovereign identity is that it is distributed, and puts the user in control of the information that makes up their identity, who the information is shared with, how much is shared, and how that information is stored. It is infinitely more secure and requires blockchain technology to build. Importantly, blockchain-based identity solutions look like any other identity solution. This underlying technology, security-by-default, and complex self-sovereign architecture are all operating at the back-end, meaning a change in infrastructure is invisible to the end user. What the industry is currently missing is a mainstream tool that is so ingrained that users don’t know it’s there until asked to take charge of their digital identities. 2019 will undoubtedly witness an emergence of new tools that can not only transform the way customers are on-boarded but bring the concept of self-sovereign identity to life. However, the benefits must be two-fold. The identity verification process for businesses needs to be streamlined and provide clear value in time and cost savings, while placing control back in the hands of individuals.",Guest Contributors,"March 22, 2019, 08:33:54 AM EDT",Beyond the Identity Honeypot: How Blockchain Can Transform E-Commerce KYC
43,"By Chandler Song, Co-Founder and CEO of Ankr ​In just a few short years, the sharing economy has become a ubiquitous concept—one that is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. The meteoric rise of tech heavyweights such as Uber and Airbnb has ushered in a new era of purchasing habits and views of ownership, disrupting industries such as public transport and real estate with lightning speed. Projected to grow to $335 billion in 2025, the sharing economy has the ability to radically transform and better democratize even the latest technological advancements, take cloud computing, for example. This could lead to greater efficiencies, access, and lower costs while challenging the existing monopoly of cloud services by comparatively traditional tech conglomerates such as Amazon and Microsoft. Powered by the cloud The underlying concepts that eventually gave rise to cloud computing can be traced back to the early days of the Internet in the 90s. As a service offering, its arrival into the tech sector was marked by the release of Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006, followed by the company’s subsequent creation of its Amazon Web Services arm, while other players such as Google and NASA began offering cloud computing products in 2008. From that point forward, the cloud computing sector has undergone multiple transformations in the last ten years, giving rise to more enterprise-ready, tailored solutions. Today, cloud computing can be broken down into three main services: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). While each type of cloud platform has its own unique advantages and use cases, at a basic level each offers the universal benefits that come with sharing computing resources, including scalability, ease of use, lowered costs, burgeoning ecosystems, and access to the latest technology. Having surpassed a state of nascency and gone on to achieve mainstream success, the question for businesses is no longer a matter of whether the implementation of cloud is necessary, but rather how or when it’ll take place. Indeed, the development of hybrid cloud solutions and container innovations such as Kubernetes mark the next phase of cloud adoption where enterprises have the option to better adapt cloud solutions to their needs, now able to blend both public and private cloud resources by moving their workloads into a multi-cloud environment. It is clear that cloud computing has revolutionized the way software and services are developed and delivered, while simultaneously bringing technology, businesses, and people together at a level of collaboration that is foreign to such a fiercely competitive industry. With a market share that is expected to reach $555 billion by 2020, the cloud services market has seen astounding growth, for reasons that parallel some of the principles behind the sharing economy—providing convenient, on-demand access without the cost and complexity of acquiring or managing the underlying technology. With the myriad of offerings that exist today, companies of varying sizes and differing needs can tailor their cloud computing solutions to meet their needs as they transition to a more digital interface. Facing the giants While enterprises can undoubtedly reap huge benefits from implementing cloud computing solutions, they come with certain drawbacks as well. According to statistics by Synergy Research Group, there is a massive imbalance in the cloud computing market share. In 2017, the top five giants—Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Alibaba—owned a combined market share of almost 75% of the entire public cloud market. This is a result of these tech conglomerates purposefully targeting enterprise users to move their workloads onto the cloud. While increased adoption is a good thing, it also means that companies may implement solutions without a real understanding or without really identifying a clear need. Their market dominance also comes at the expense of the small-to-medium sized cloud operators who, lacking the scale and financial muscle of these leaders, are unable to keep pace with their larger competitors. The existing monopoly of cloud computing services can also significantly impact the ability of smaller businesses to implement such solutions, by making access to the cloud incredibly expensive. As the technology continues to develop, enterprises will also need to upskill their workers accordingly. In addition to that, there are several other concerns surrounding the long-term viability for cloud implementation, ranging from security, to cost management. Though enterprise adoption of cloud computing continues to rise, companies are forced to confront the reality that mounting costs and growing technological sophistication could ultimately hinder long-term implementation. An inclusive economy With the proliferation of the sharing economy, distributed cloud computing has emerged as a way to tackle the limitations of today’s centralized cloud and mitigate rising costs while monetizing existing resources, leading to greater profits. It can also lead to improved security, when the distributed aspect is paired with other technologies such as blockchain in order to build a decentralized network. Until the advent of distributed technology, immense amounts of idle computing power have remained untapped worldwide. As more and more computers, smartphones, and other devices come online, the amount of idle power will grow too. The concepts of decentralization and a sharing economy can help tackle the growing issue of cloud waste, by allowing enterprises and personal users to feed their idle computing resources into a shared marketplace. By taking advantage of these underutilized resources from individuals across the globe, we will be able to yield tremendous computing power to support the rising demand, without having to rely on one central hub that can be easily exploited or monopolized. Transitioning to a more digitized state of operations and storage should be a step forward that all enterprises, big or small, should be able to take; by disrupting the cloud computing sector with a sharing economy model, a wider range of businesses will be able to leverage the benefits of the cloud without fears of skyrocketing costs, while simultaneously democratizing access to this solution as a whole.",Guest Contributors,"March 22, 2019, 08:30:21 AM EDT",Disrupting the Disruptors: Transforming the Cloud Computing Market
44,"By Landon Manning The federal government of the Commonwealth of Australia announced this month that it would begin a major initiative to sponsor the development of blockchain technology. Karen Andrews, Australia’s Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, claimed that $100,000 AUD ($70,900 USD) would be allocated to “nurture a ‘burgeoning’ industry,” according to iTnews. Also noteworthy is that this announcement came barely a month after the country’s Digital Transformation Agency formally recommended that the government take a more cautious approach to distributed ledger technology adoption, following an inquiry into the matter requested by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Nevertheless, the federal government is proceeding with an investment plan, and the roadmap for development specifically mentions a focus on “regulation, skills and capacity building, innovation, investment and international competitiveness and collaboration,” with the eventual goal of making Australia a global leader in blockchain technology. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) will be partnering with private blockchain company Data61 — which has previously worked with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). The CBA has shown a particular interest in blockchain technology on multiple occasions, in addition to its new partnership. In July 2018, for example, it partnered with five domestic and international supply chain companies to track a multi-ton shipment of almonds from Australia to Germany. The potential to improve international supply chains is a common use case for blockchain technology, so it seems natural that a government institution would use this as a possible test ground for distributed ledgers. Much of the preliminary phase of development on this project will be focused on gathering academic and industry experts to make a roadmap for Australia’s path forward. Much of the $100,000 AUD will be used “to bankroll attendance by Australian companies at Austrade’s third Mission to Consensus in New York in May,” an event that Andrews called “a landmark event for the blockchain industry.” While there, Australian companies will be able to show off their talents to a diverse range of international users, not to mention investors. Simon Birmingham, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, stated that this event “will present significant opportunities for Australian tech companies to showcase their products on the world-stage.” He added, “It is vital Australia and our tech companies stay ahead of the game in one of the world’s fastest growing technology sectors.”",Bitcoin Magazine,"March 22, 2019, 08:22:37 AM EDT",Australian Government to Nurture Blockchain Technology With Major Investment

Netflix    CEO Reed Hastings practiced humility when he was asked about new   competitors like Disney's and Apple's upcoming streaming services   this week. ""These are amazing, large, well-funded companies with   very significant efforts,"" he said. ""But you do your best job   when you have great competitors.""

Read more on five of those efforts below. Doubling down on international growth During the two days at Netflix's Los Angeles offices, one   number came up over and over again: Only 5% of the world's   population are native English speakers. ""Historically, we've seen   the large majority of international content be produced right   here in Hollywood in English,"" said Netflix chief product officer   Greg Peters. ""And it's in that disconnect that we see a   tremendous opportunity, because we believe that great stories   should be able to come from anywhere on the planet."" Netflix's strategy to reach the other 95% of the world is to   produce local content, and then find global audiences for that   content. Peters named ""La Casa de Papel,"" ""Sex Education,""   ""Dark,"" and ""The Rain"" as some of the service's international   success stories. ""All these shows are popular in their own   country, but they're also traveling and finding audiences around   the world,"" he said. ""Audiences that would've most likely never   experienced these kind of shows before."" Key to those efforts is Netflix's focus on dubbing. ""We want   to provide entertainment to everybody around the world, no matter   what you speak, where you live, where you're from, what you eat,""   said the company's international dubbing director Debra Chinn.   Her team has been rolling out dubbed versions of Netflix's   content in up to 27 languages, including English - a particular   challenge, since native English-language speakers typically   aren't used to dubbed content. ""We are taking this new initiative   very seriously,"" Chinn said.  The art of dubbing, as demonstrated by Netflix to     journalists this week.  Going short, and out-of-order Netflix may be best known for binge-watching, with its app   conveniently starting the next episode as soon as you have   finished one. However, Netflix VP of product Todd Yellin   suggested this week that the company may mix things up a bit in   the future. ""How about anthologies? How about something like   'Chef's Table'?"" he asked. ""You don't have to watch it in the   order that we tell you to."" Yellin also quoted the company's latest animated sci-fi   anthology ""Love, Death & Robots"" as a perfect example of a   show that can be watched in any particular order - which is   exactly what the company is experimenting with through a special   episode picker right on your TV home page. ""Some members will get   a special row, and that row will have all the different, let's   call them animated shorts for grownups, from 'Love, Death &   Robots,'"" he said.  Some Netflix members get to see a special episode picker     for the service's new show ""Love, Death & Robots.""  The show is also notable for being an experiment in brevity.   ""Some of them are five minutes long. Some of them are 17 minutes   long,"" Yellin said. ""Why should we be constrained by the amount   of time? With internet TV, the schedule is yours."" But while Jeffrey Katzenberg and   others are rediscovering short-form    as a mobile-driven video format, Yellin was quick to emphasize   that the length of a show was purely a creative decision for   Netflix. ""It's really about flexibility in storytelling. Some   stories are best told in six minutes and some stories are best   told in 10 hours,"" he said in an interview with   Variety    . The flip side of this line of thinking is that Netflix may do   more short-form content over time if the right project comes   along. Said Yellin: ""We're experimenting with short-form, and   we'll see if it works."" Making shows and movies look and sound their best Six-hundred unique devices access Netflix every month,   according to Peters. And in February, out of those 600 million,   125 million were HDR-capable. ""That's an amazing adoption rate of   a new video format that we are enabling by working both with the   creative community and with our device partners,"" Peters   said. In addition to embracing HDR for its own productions, the   streaming service is also increasingly using Dolby Atmos to   enable a theater-like in-home audio experience. ""The sound of a   movie is another character, is another performer in the show,""   said ""Lost in Space"" showrunner and executive producer Zack   Estrin, who argued that this was also true for shows without big   soundscapes, like comedies. ""If you feel the laughter around you   as opposed to just on that wall, it feels like you are in the   audience,"" Estrin said. But while Netflix has benefited from new audio and display   technologies, it also has to deal with some of the downsides.   This includes default settings for TVs that are optimized for   brightness, and not necessarily accuracy. ""Most TVs tend to   over-brighten the color,"" said Netflix post tools integration   manager Richard Smith. ""Bright shiny objects, bright shiny   objects - that's not what we want,"" added Estrin.  Sony's latest TV set, compared to a studio reference     monitor made by the company.  As a remedy for overly bright screens, Netflix has been   working with select display makers on a dedicated setting to   restore accuracy. This ""Netflix Calibrated Mode"" was first added   to select Sony TVs last year. This year, the company is going to   team up with other TV makers to add it to their devices as well,   but company representatives weren't ready to share the names of   those TV makers just yet. Infusing the production process with 21st-century   technology As Netflix continues its shift toward original content, the   company is also exploring ways to make content production more   efficient. Netflix has a dedicated team that has been building   apps and services for the production process, including a   contacts manager, a distribution tool that helps to update an   entire crew with the latest version of call sheets and other   important documents, and   an app called Move that    helps track the schedule of a production. Netflix is gradually introducing these tools to the production   process, said studio technology director Amie Tornincasa. ""We   start small, with seeds."" The best approach was not to replace   all of the technology that a production is using with a whole new   set of tools, but integrate with their workflow and improve   things from there. In 2017, Netflix tested some of its new tools   with 10 different productions. In 2018, 40 productions made use   of at least some of the apps and services developed by   Tornincasa's team.  Netflix's new script markup tool.  This year, Netflix wants to start testing a new tool that   helps production teams mark up a script, and enable them to move   away from pen, paper, and highlighter. ""We want to take the   script and turn it into an interactive breakdown tool,"" said   content engineering product director Chris Goss. Helping Netflix users find new gems Netflix frequently tests new iterations of its TV and mobile   interfaces, and Hastings made it clear this week that his   company's work on perfecting that experience is far from done.   ""It's a little bit too much like the classified ads and not   enough like a magazine,"" he said about Netflix's current   interface. Yellin also readily admitted that the company can do better,   for instance when it comes to showing the right content to the   right person in the right way. ""As we've moved increasingly to   original content, it's content that they've never heard of   before,"" Yellin told   Variety    . ""So we have to get them excited."" Netflix has for some time personalized images to present the   same show in different ways to different audiences. Now, it is   also testing personalizing text descriptions and even tags, said   Yellin: ""Different tags work for different people,"" he said.  Netflix also relies on tagging to personalize the curation     of its shows.  Even the videos shown as part of Netflix's interface are   increasingly being personalized. For instance, Netflix cuts   different trailers of its originals and shows them to different   audiences, said Yellin. And later this year, it will test videos   fine-tuned to tell the story of a kids show's character in its   own voice to younger viewers.  ""They're shorter, they're in the character's voice and they're   focused on the character,"" explained Netflix TV product   innovation director Cameron Johnson. ""They're not telling you the   full arc of the story, they're just saying: This is who this   character is."" Netflix has also been running tests to adapt the size of cover   art in its interface based on personalization. However, Yellin   added that the company has been carefully weighing the amount of   content shown to each viewer as they browse Netflix's catalog -   even if the optimal result may not look like a glossy magazine.   ""Newspapers existed for a couple of centuries by running   classified ads, and it was really important to them,"" he joked in   response to Hastings' comments.

49,"With Lyft's IPO, there is increased attention on the rapidly growing ridesharing business, even though it is unprofitable. The fundamental issue facing Lyft, as well as Uber, is how will it compete against or use autonomous ride services. Will it become a blockbuster in this new industry or displaced by new technology, just as Blockbuster Video was? Blockbuster Video was a hot stock to own in the 1990s with rapid growth, reaching almost $6 billion in revenue in 2003. Netflix began competing using its mail-based subscription model and then introduced streaming video in 2007. Blockbuster could not compete with streaming video, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2010. In my previous Seeking Alpha articles, I explained the advantages of autonomous ride services (essentially Uber or Lyft without a driver) over ridesharing. Here we will look at the implications on Lyft and its ARS strategy, but first, let's review an updated business model comparison that was introduced in a previous article -- Uber Must Have Autonomous Ride Services ( https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200188-uber-must-autonomous-ride-services ) A business model defines the fundamental way a business works in economic or financial terms. It is a basic element of strategy. A business model is not intended to be precise; it's directionally correct. It's not a financial projection, even though it frequently appears as one. It uses financial projections to illustrate directionally how the business works. Let's compare the business models for ridesharing and autonomous ride services, modeling them on the income and costs for a typical trip.  The business model projected for ridesharing starts with data from Lyft and Uber and then projects some improvements. It uses revenue and cost for a 7-mile trip, which from many estimates is a typical Lyft or Uber trip. The price per-trip varies widely based on the time of the day, drive time, and distance. However, a 7-mile trip for $16.00 (approximately $2.30 per mile) is reasonably representative of a typical Lyft or Uber trip. The driver cost uses the percentages from Lyft's and Uber's recent revenue statements. For example, Lyf t report ed $8.1 billion in bookings with a $5.9 billion or 73.4% driver cost in its S-1. Of Uber's $12 billion in quarterly billings, $9.2 billion (approximately 76%) went to its drivers and related expenses. The remainder of the ridesharing cost estimates come directly from the percentages in their respective financial statements. They classify operating expenses somewhat differently, so the total operating expense is the best comparison. Using these ratios, both Lyft and Uber report losses on every trip, just as they do overall in their financial statements. The ridesharing projected model averages the driver cost between the two services. It also assumes operating expense improvements with increased economies of scale. It also assumes a significant reduction in R&D costs since much of the current R&D is going toward developing autonomous vehicles. With these projections, ridesharing is approximately breakeven. In the modeling for ARS, I use an average of $1.35 per mile, so that the 7-mile trip will be $9.45. This is approximately 40% less than a comparable ridesharing price for the same trip. ARS pricing will vary too. Initially, it may be closer to ridesharing pricing since it will be capacity constrained, but when ARS competitors have local fleets of 1,000 or more vehicles then prices will be reduced. The overhead costs for the ARS model include similar operations costs and R&D (which would be about $3 billion per year allocated across all ARS vehicles). The end result in this model is an operating income estimate of 25%. The ARS business model is significantly more profitable, even at a much lower price per trip. There are no driver related costs in the ARS model since there are no drivers. Instead, there are significant capital costs from investment in autonomous ride services vehicles. In my research, I estimate that a typical ARS vehicle will make 50 trips per day (Waymo uses the same estimate), for 350-days-per-year, with a 7-mile per trip average. Each vehicle will generate approximately $150,000 per year in revenue. I estimate the operating cost per vehicle at over $52,000 per year. This includes fuel, insurance, taxes, maintenance and cleaning ($20,000/year), and depreciation ($20,000/year). This would yield a 60% return on investment for a $100,000 ARS vehicle. Readers of some of my previous articles were skeptical of the 50 trip per day assumption for autonomous ride services, so I also included a much lower 30 trip per day projection. This still shows a much more competitive and profitable model than ridesharing with an operating profit of 22% but a lower, although still viable, return on investment of 34%. ARS could charge a higher price per trip and be even more profitable. Competition for ARS could force the price per trip even lower, but this lower price will most likely expand the market even faster, and increase vehicle utilization. I modeled a lower cost-per-trip of $6, which is 65% less than the price of an Uber trip. At this price point, assuming somewhat higher demand and utilization, the ARS model is still profitable. The fundamental strategic difference in these business models is the well-proven examples throughout history; technology and capital-intensive business models displace labor-intensive business models. When this happens, the labor-intensive model loses every time. At almost half the price per trip, ARS is much more profitable. Ridesharing is not yet profitable, and it cannot hope to be viable at these lower competitive prices. ARS will eventually displace ridesharing. One can argue about the timeframe for this. Is it going to start in two years or four years? Will ARS take 20% of the ridesharing market by 2025 or 50% of it? Regardless of timeframe, the conclusion is inevitable: ARS will eventually displace ridesharing. Autonomous ride services will become a very large market. Ridesharing is currently a large market and growing rapidly. ARS will displace ridesharing over time and also accelerate the market because of much lower prices per trip. ARS will be a geographic market, not a global market . It is a services market, not a product market. Approximately a half-dozen major companies are expected to compete for that market in the U.S., rolling out their ARS services by metropolitan areas. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ), is the first to market. Cruise Automation ( GM ) is expected to follow in 2019. Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC ( F ) is planning on launching its ARS services in 2021. ARS is crucial for Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ) because it will cannibalize their ridesharing business. They need to compete in this market or eventually face extinction, but they are both behind in developing autonomous vehicles. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), is the wildcard in the ARS market. It has yet to declare its intentions, but it is investing heavily in AV development and testing, and the ARS market is the only one that makes sense for it. The advantage that Lyft and Uber may have in entering the ARS market is that they already have popular ridesharing apps. They can simply add an ARS service to their apps and riders can choose what they want. Others will need to get customers to use their apps to request a ride, but that may not be a substantial problem when ARS comes into a metropolitan area. The Uber and Lyft brands name may be an advantage, but it's hard to rely on a brand name as a differentiator. Lyft is investing in developing autonomous vehicles, but not as much as Uber, Waymo, Apple, Cruise Automation or Ford. Its strategy appears to rely on the technology development of others. Lyft's strategy is focused on building a network of partnerships. Lyft describes its two-pronged autonomous vehicle strategy in its S-1 as follows: Pioneering Autonomous Vehicle Strategy. We are investing in autonomous technology and employ a two-pronged strategy to bring autonomous vehicles to market. Our Open Platform provides market-leading developers of autonomous vehicle technology access to our network to enable their vehicles to fulfill rides on our platform. Simultaneously, we are building our own world-class autonomous vehicle system at our Level 5 Engineering Center, with the goal of ensuring access to affordable and reliable autonomous technology. We believe that the strength of our brand, our trusted relationships with riders and our expertise in operating a ridesharing network at scale, as well as our two-pronged strategy to bring autonomous vehicles to market, will be competitive advantages that will enable us to capture value in the emerging autonomous vehicle ecosystem. Lyft has several strategic partnerships that may offer access to autonomous vehicles. Its Open Platform partnership with Aptiv has enabled the commercial deployment of a small fleet of autonomous vehicles on its platform in Las Vegas. The success of Lyft's strategy of partnering with others providing the autonomous vehicles for ARS is risky. This strategy relies on partners that have invested billions in developing autonomous driving technology giving Lyft control over riders and letting Lyft take a significant portion of the ARS rider fees. A few years ago, this seemed like a good strategy, and there were many partnerships, but then these companies realized that control of the autonomous ride services platform would dictate who made money. So, then they went off to develop their own ride services. Waymo decided to have its own platform, Waymo One. Then Ford and GM spun-off their own ARS businesses It seems like this may not be evolving as Lyft intended. So, Lyft was forced to increase its own AV development investment. Lyft appears to acknowledge the inevitability of autonomous ride services and discloses the problem of not having an AV partner as a risk. If we are unable to efficiently develop our own autonomous vehicle technologies or develop partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. With its IPO, Lyft will have the financial resources to last for years even with continuing losses in ridesharing. It won't have sufficient financial resources to develop and launch autonomous ride services. It could possibly acquire a small company to accelerate its autonomous vehicle development, but it won't have the immense capital required to create autonomous fleets for ARS. I previously saw Lyft as a potential acquisition candidate, but at the expected valuation, this is less likely. It will be a little bit like someone buying a mansion on the ocean and then tearing it down to build another house. It's not rational but could happen. It will be too expensive for GM and Ford to acquire Lyft. Google could acquire it to combine with Waymo, but may not need to do that. In any case, Lyft's voting structure will discourage potential acquirers. So, the fundamental questions for investors in Lyft revolve around its strategy for autonomous ride services. Just like streaming video displaced video rental, ARS will replace ridesharing. Investing in Lyft should really be done as an investment in its longer-term strategy for autonomous ride services compared to its expected competitors.

51,"Valued at a mouthwatering $31 billion, Airbnb is now hinting that it might not IPO this year after all—but sometimes it’s better to wait to iron out a few kinds when you’re a startup that is responsible for nothing short of revolutionizing travel. ""We have already said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019,"" Nathan Blecharczyk, an Airbnb cofounder, told Business Insider in an email interview. Just like Uber has been plagued with stories of rape, murder, theft and the like, Airbnb has its share of unfortunate events. There are always problems in the evolutionary chain, and in this case, expanding your travel options means sacrificing a layer of security, safety and accountability that would have with a hotel. The most recent upset was the publicity around the confession of the murder this week of a guest by an Airbnb host in Melbourne, Australia in 2017, when the host realized he was short $149 to pay his bill. The host, 42-year-old Jason Colton, has been sentenced to prison for 11 years after copping to manslaughter and testifying that he hadn’t meant to kill his guest; rather, he had sought to render him unconscious. The guest, 36-year-old Ramis Jonuzi, was attacked in the home by Colton and two others who beat and strangled him to death. Airbnb has over five million listings on offer, and it’s not feasible to do security-related background checks on every property owner, especially when those listings span the globe. All you can rely on for accountability is user reviews. It’s an evolutionary leap of faith—and one that we really should be able to take. Still, the stories of murder and mayhem don’t help when a startup is so close to going public. In December 2018, a security guard at an Airbnb villa in Costa Rica was arrested for the murder of a Florida woman who had been staying there. Her body was found in the woods near the villa, with evidence that the cause of death was blunt force trauma. The month before, a couple vacationing in Mexico died of carbon monoxide poisoning in their Airbnb rental thanks to a faulty heater. This latter incident is less likely to happen in the U.S. because Airbnb hands out free carbon monoxide detectors to anyone who asks for them, and the laws in the U.S. require all homes to have these detectors, so Airbnb requires all property owners to have them in order to be listed. In the meantime, investors are growing increasingly anxious at the prospects of an Airbnb IPO, and many are likely still holding out for that to happen this year. But Airbnb still has a few things it wants to do, apparently, before going public. This year already, Airbnb has acquired Gaest and HotelTonight. The HotelTonight acquisition will give Airbnb another chance to increase growth and diversity because it adds an app for selling last-minute, unused inventory at boutique and independent hotels. Valued at $463 million in March 2017, HotelTonight is believed to be worth far more now. What’s up next? Possibly an investment in India. Reports have emerged this week that it may be planning to back an Indian hotel startup called Oyo to the tune of up to $200 million. The Indian startup is tearing it up lately—it’s even backed by SoftBank’s Vision Fund. So, what about the IPO? Airbnb clearly has more acquisitions in mind to bolster its position before going public, so the overriding sentiment is that it’ll wait until 2020.

55," By Robert Viglione, CEO of  Horizen Despite the uncertain state of the cryptocurrency market, demand for jobs in blockchain remains at an all-time high. According to a new report by  hired.com , global demand for blockchain engineers is up 517 percent from 2018, with more than  5,700  blockchain jobs currently available on the recruiting website Glassdoor alone. This is certainly welcome news for blockchain’s long-term health; however, it comes with an unfortunate caveat. Currently, there are more jobs available than there are people capable of filling them. As is the case with many emerging industries, aspiring professionals in blockchain don’t have access to the resources required to learn industry-specific skills, leaving job listings open, companies scrambling, and the industry at a loss. As we prepare for the coming year, blockchain projects should make a concerted effort to create educational programs that foster the next generation of blockchain developers. Following the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, “an investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” In many ways, blockchain expertise is a disruptive skill, meaning it’s both fast-growing and hard to find. Blockchain recruiters cast a wide net for every position and only have a limited number of experts in blockchain-focused practice areas (e.g., consumer technology, privacy, or the supply chain) to choose from. For blockchain companies, this is why developing and conducting education programs is so important. By teaching aspiring developers about the intricacies of the decentralized economy, companies can expedite the hiring process, creating a direct link between top-tier talent and their top line. Newer generations of blockchain professionals may take solace in the fact that  42 percent  of colleges and universities have started offering blockchain classes in their curriculums. However, there are still a substantial number of developers, both up-and-coming and experienced, that don’t have access to the time or capital necessary to enroll in expensive postgraduate programs. Offering free or low-cost educational programs may seem fiscally counterproductive on its surface, but blockchain companies upskilling developers are already reaping the benefits of deeper and more diverse talent pools. These educational initiatives can be as simple as asking current employees to hold after-hours programs or online classes, and the results will have a lasting impact on both the company and the industry at large. Some projects are already setting an important precedent here. B9lab Academy has launched online coursework that deals with the nuances of the Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Tezos protocols and development.  Truffle, a smart contract suite, has created Truffle University, a training program purposed to help software developers become professional blockchain engineers. At Horizen, we recently announced the Horizen Academy, a comprehensive educational experience focused on blockchain technology, privacy, and the Horizen platform — all free of charge. By presenting industry-specific material to developers at any skill level, we aim to make radical usability and widespread adoption of privacy protocols a reality. Amid rapid advancements in the blockchain industry, it’s important we don’t lose sight of the fact that talent remains our most important asset. At present,  40 percent  of employees who don’t receive the necessary job training leave their positions within their first year. With this in mind, it’s no wonder that  68 percent  of workers say that professional development is the most important workplace policy that a company can implement. If we truly wish to attract some of the best and brightest minds in the world to this emerging space, we will have to be willing to teach them how to walk before they can run. It may take time and effort, but the results will ultimately pay dividends in the creation of an aspiring generation of developers ready to reimagine the world today with the power of blockchain technology.",Guest Contributors,"March 20, 2019, 01:31:43 PM EDT",The Value of Educating the Next Generation of Blockchain Developers
56," If you are one of the investors that feels like you are hearing more and more about the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme, you are probably right. AI is a prime example of a theme of tomorrow with accessible, practical investment opportunities that are reachable today. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are bolstering the accessibility of AI-related investments. By some estimates, there are more than 40 US-listed ETFs with some AI exposure. A smaller, but growing number are explicitly dedicated to AI and related themes. The Global X Future Analytics Tech ETF (AIQ) is part of that group. AIQ, which turns a year old in May, tracks the Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index. Like many AI ETFs, AIQ lacks the lengthy track record many advisors and investors crave when evaluating funds, but growth expectations for AI indicate waiting for these funds to age could mean missed opportunities. “Worldwide spending on artificial intelligence (AI) systems is forecast to reach $35.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 44.0% over the amount spent in 2018,” according to International Data Corp.'s (IDC) recently published Worldwide Semiannual Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide. A Growth Play Many thematic ETFs are chock full of stocks with the growth designation. Some of AIQ's 80 components can be considered growth stocks, but the AI fund's components have an average market value of $80.78 billion, indicating the fund is not a bet on small-cap growth, a rewarding, but often volatile market segment. In fact, some AIQ's holdings, including top 10 components Intel Corp. (INTC), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM), reside in some value indexes. AIQ's price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios of 4.47 and 21.32 are not excessive relative to the comparable metrics of 6.00 and 18.71 on the Nasdaq-100 Index. While AIQ holds some growth stocks, the fund's growth feel is heavily derived from broader AI industry trends. The aforementioned IDC report notes “pending on AI systems will more than double to $79.2 billion in 2022 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.0% over the 2018-2022 forecast period.” Fostering that growth are AI's myriad applications across multiple industries, including financial services, healthcare and retail. “Global spending on AI systems will be led by the retail industry where companies will invest $5.9 billion this year on solutions such as automated customer service agents and expert shopping advisors & product recommendations,” according to IDC. “Banking will be the second largest industry with $5.6 billion going toward AI-enabled solutions including automated threat intelligence & prevention systems and fraud analysis & investigation systems.” Taking Flight Thematic ETFs have the potential to outperform traditional sector funds. Consistently delivering on that potential is what advisors and investors are looking for. This year, AIQ is up 20.92%, topping the Technology Select Sector Index by about 270 basis points. Some data points indicate investors are starting to nibble at AIQ. This month, the AI ETF has seen inflows of $1.55 million, bringing its total assets under management to $39 million. Those flows accompany a March gain of 3.39% for AIQ.",Todd Shriber,"March 20, 2019, 01:27:20 PM EDT",An Idea For The Awesome AI Investment Theme

58,"Netflix    vice president of product Todd Yellin borrowed a line from one of   the company's newest stars this week to describe what makes its   service special: ""How do we measure success? Three letters: joy,""   Yellin said to pictures from ""Tidying Up With Marie Kondo"" during   a press event in Los Angeles. ""If people enjoy our content, if   they're loving to come to   Netflix    , then we succeed,"" he said. But as avid viewers of Kondo's hit Netflix show know, there is   another side to the KonMari art of tidying up: If something   doesn't spark joy, then it's time to let it go. And Netflix has been letting go of many things lately: Just   last week, the video service announced that it would cancel the   show ""   One Day at a Time    "" after three seasons. Last month, it gave ""Friends From College""   the ax. And over the past several months, Netflix has pulled the   plug on all of its Marvel superhero shows,   including ""Jessica Jones,"" ""The Punisher,"" "" Luke Cage""    and   ""Daredevil."" makeArticleAd(); Fans have been in uproar about many of these cancellations.   Particularly the cancellation of ""One Day at a   Time""    has caused a public outcry, with critics lamenting that Netflix   was betraying its own commitment to diversity. Speaking at the same two-day press event as Yellin, Netflix   CEO Reed Hastings made it clear that he wasn't taking pleasure in   cancelling shows either. ""We try to avoid it,"" he said. ""But   sometimes it's no longer a good use of the customer's money."" Netflix has traditionally bucked the trend of sharing the kind   of overnight ratings that have long been a staple of the   television world, with executives arguing that these numbers   didn't matter to the company in the same way as they did to   ad-supported TV networks. Recently, Netflix has shared an   increasing amount of carefully cherry-picked data about some of   its success stories. For instance, on a recent       earnings call    , Netflix executives highlighted that the movie ""Bird Box"" was   expected to   attract 80 million viewers within    four weeks of release. Netflix hasn't shared any similar numbers about cancelled   shows. For ""   One Day at a Time    ,"" the company instead tweeted that ""simply not enough people   watched to justify another season."" Hastings echoed those remarks more generally this week when   asked by   Variety    about Netflix's approach to cancellations, saying some shows were   simply too expensive to keep them running on the service without   a sizable audience. ""We can have small shows that do very well,   we can have expensive shows that do very well,"" he said. The   trouble was if shows, especially the ones costing more, fell   below that mark. ""The only case where we end up cancelling is   where it's pretty expensive and not so much viewing,"" Hastings   said. In other words: it's more or less business as usual for   Netflix when it comes to cancelling shows. Still, that in itself   is notable, simply because Netflix has so many times defied the   rules of the business, be it by eschewing ratings or with the   introduction of binge watching. And then there was the case of ""Arrested Development,"" a show   that struggled on Fox, but that was picked up by Netflix after   the streamer saw a growing audience for previous seasons on its   service. That reversal of fortune led some to believe that   quality TV shows that were doomed to be canceled on network TV   had a better chance to find an audience on Netflix, with good   shows making the cut as fans congregate around them. In reality, ""Arrested Development"" may have been the exception   to prove the rule. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos   suggested as much in a conversation with   Variety    Monday. ""Some shows grow year on year, but not that many,"" he   said. ""It's happened, but it's not that common."" That's in part due to the ever-growing content catalog of the   service. With Netflix debuting 600 new shows a year, it becomes   that much harder for struggling shows to grow their audience,   said Sarandos. So if something doesn't click right away, it's a   lot less likely that it will become a success story over   time. This means that Netflix will keep breaking the hearts of avid   fans, and letting go of shows that don't spark enough joy for the   rest of its audience - even if the company won't tell us how many   viewers a show had before it got axed.  Related stories  Netflix Will Test Character-Driven Video       Previews for Its Kids Content   ""Stranger Things 3"" Game Coming July 4   Netflix Drops 'Stranger Things' Season 3       Trailer (Watch) Netflix    vice president of product Todd Yellin borrowed a line from one of   the company's newest stars this week to describe what makes its   service special: ""How do we measure success? Three letters: joy,""   Yellin said to pictures from ""Tidying Up With Marie Kondo"" during   a press event in Los Angeles. ""If people enjoy our content, if   they're loving to come to   Netflix    , then we succeed,"" he said. But as avid viewers of Kondo's hit Netflix show know, there is   another side to the KonMari art of tidying up: If something   doesn't spark joy, then it's time to let it go. And Netflix has been letting go of many things lately: Just   last week, the video service announced that it would cancel the   show ""   One Day at a Time    "" after three seasons. Last month, it gave ""Friends From College""   the ax. And over the past several months, Netflix has pulled the   plug on all of its Marvel superhero shows,   including ""Jessica Jones,"" ""The Punisher,"" "" Luke Cage""    and   ""Daredevil."" Fans have been in uproar about many of these cancellations.   Particularly the cancellation of ""One Day at a   Time""    has caused a public outcry, with critics lamenting that Netflix   was betraying its own commitment to diversity. Speaking at the same two-day press event as Yellin, Netflix   CEO Reed Hastings made it clear that he wasn't taking pleasure in   cancelling shows either. ""We try to avoid it,"" he said. ""But   sometimes it's no longer a good use of the customer's money."" Netflix has traditionally bucked the trend of sharing the kind   of overnight ratings that have long been a staple of the   television world, with executives arguing that these numbers   didn't matter to the company in the same way as they did to   ad-supported TV networks. Recently, Netflix has shared an   increasing amount of carefully cherry-picked data about some of   its success stories. For instance, on a recent       earnings call    , Netflix executives highlighted that the movie ""Bird Box"" was   expected to   attract 80 million viewers within    four weeks of release. Netflix hasn't shared any similar numbers about cancelled   shows. For ""   One Day at a Time    ,"" the company instead tweeted that ""simply not enough people   watched to justify another season."" Hastings echoed those remarks more generally this week when   asked by   Variety    about Netflix's approach to cancellations, saying some shows were   simply too expensive to keep them running on the service without   a sizable audience. ""We can have small shows that do very well,   we can have expensive shows that do very well,"" he said. The   trouble was if shows, especially the ones costing more, fell   below that mark. ""The only case where we end up cancelling is   where it's pretty expensive and not so much viewing,"" Hastings   said. In other words: it's more or less business as usual for   Netflix when it comes to cancelling shows. Still, that in itself   is notable, simply because Netflix has so many times defied the   rules of the business, be it by eschewing ratings or with the   introduction of binge watching. And then there was the case of ""Arrested Development,"" a show   that struggled on Fox, but that was picked up by Netflix after   the streamer saw a growing audience for previous seasons on its   service. That reversal of fortune led some to believe that   quality TV shows that were doomed to be canceled on network TV   had a better chance to find an audience on Netflix, with good   shows making the cut as fans congregate around them. In reality, ""Arrested Development"" may have been the exception   to prove the rule. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos   suggested as much in a conversation with   Variety    Monday. ""Some shows grow year on year, but not that many,"" he   said. ""It's happened, but it's not that common."" That's in part due to the ever-growing content catalog of the   service.

59," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google division took the wraps off its streaming gaming platform at a GDC 2019 keynote on Tuesday. Formerly known by the code names Project Stream and Project Yeti, the new game service is called Stadia, and it will launch later in 2019. While Alphabet stock was up a percent or so, the big winners appear to be companies that will be needed to support Stadia. Game developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) notched a 3.22% boost, while chip maker Advanced Micro Devices  (NASDAQ: AMD ) shot up nearly 12% after the announcement.  Stadia has the potential to be a game changer (no pun intended) but the real winners in the short term are going to be the companies that Google needs to lean on to make its game streaming platform happen. Leading up to yesterday's Game Developer Conference keynote, we had a pretty good idea of what Google was up to . After all, the company had publicly trialled the experience of playing AAA video games in a browser with its Project Stream , which wrapped up earlier this year. Google's keynote was all about what it has been describing as ""the future of gaming,"" which now has a name and a launch timeframe . Stadia is the official name of Google's new game streaming platform, and the company says it will launch later in 2019 in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Stadia will let players stream video games over the internet to devices running the Chrome web browser, through a Google Chromecast or to a Google Pixel device. No console or gaming PC is required, which would cut costs considerably for players. The company is also releasing a Stadia game controller that links to the service directly over Wi-Fi, and has buttons dedicated to YouTube and Google Assistant. Speaking of Youtube, Google says you'll be able to watch gameplay on its popular video-sharing service, push a button and instantly be able to play the video game. Stadia will r equire a 25Mbps internet connection and promises 4K resolution at 60fps, with plans to eventually offer up to 8K resolution and up to 120fps. The global video game industry was worth $138 billion last year , and it's growing. If Stadia can grab a chunk of that, there is a real payoff for Google, which is why Alphabet stock nudged up 1.17% on the announcement. There is also the potential for game developers to sell to a wider audience, and Google says over 100 game studios already have Stadia development kits. Some game development companies got a serious boost from the Stadia announcement, including Activision Blizzard. Ubisoft Entertainment  (OTCMKTS: UBSFY ) - the publisher of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was the game tested with Project Stream - also saw a 2.99% bump. The big winner for now though is AMD. To launch Stadia, Google says it is investing in custom GPUs from AMD for its data centers. That's a big, exclusive hardware sale with the potential to keep going well beyond the launch.  While some game developer stocks saw a boost from Google's announcement, there is also uncertainty in the industry. Google is creating its own game studio to release Stadia-exclusive titles and that means competition. Developing for yet another platform means additional costs. Some video game console makers also took a hit. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) held steady, but Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Nintendo (OTCMKTS: NTDOY ) both closed down over 3%. GameStop (NYSE: GME ) has a lot to lose if gaming ditches physical discs for streaming, and it took a 0.99% hit on the day. What was missing from Google's Stadia announcement? Besides Doom Eternal - which will also be available for PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch - details on launch titles were thin. Also missing was the cost. We're assuming Google will charge a monthly subscription fee for access to Stadia, and that the optional controller would be sold separately, but there has been no confirmation. What we know now is that Google is angling for a larger cut of the $138 billion video game industry, in a big move that may have significant upside for Alphabet stock. In the meantime, Stadia partners like AMD are reaping the benefits as Google spends to build out the service, while console makers and game sellers watch to see if their business faces a real threat. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post AMD Stock Rockets on Google Stadia Announcement appeared first on InvestorPlace .

61,"The boom-and-bust cycle of the memory market has sent Micron (MU) stock cratering as much as 56% from its 52-week high of $64. Semiconductor overcapacity and lowered demand has impacted Micron’s pricing power and profit margins. As such, analysts have had little choice but to reduce their projections for Micron’s earnings and revenue in the coming quarters. And we will see just how accurate these lowered estimates are. The nation’s largest memory manufacturer is set to report second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings after the closing bell Wednesday. While the lowered bar should help the company meet or beat its estimates, that might not be enough to change negative sentiment about the health of the memory chip market. Softening DRAM prices have chipped away at Micron’s business, though Micron management, which has steered the company towards twelve straight earnings beats, has downplayed the issue, expressing confidence the company can overcome the cycle. On Wednesday the company must give investors reason to fully believe that the cyclical nature of the memory chip business — the type that stores information in mobile devices and helps processors crunch data in computers and data centers —  won’t impact its long-term prospects. The company must also demonstrate signs of a turnaround by guiding in a way that suggests confidence about what investors should expect in the second half of 2019. For the quarter that ended February, the Boise, Idaho-based company is expected to earn $1.70 per share on revenue of $5.89 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $2.82 per share on revenue of $7.35 billion. For the full year, ending August, earnings are projected to be $7.36 per share, down from $11.95 per share a year ago, while full-year revenue of $24.89 billion would decline 18% year over year. The expected year-over-year decline on both the top and bottom lines have been the major reason for the stock’s punishment. But beyond the headline numbers, all eyes will be on Micron’s forecast for the current quarter and the full fiscal year. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra was optimistic about the state of DRAM prices, saying in October that the supply and demand imbalance should last only a quarter or two. Micron stock reacted favorably to those statements, climbing some 16% since the company’s last earnings report. The Street, however, will want some sign from Micron on Wednesday to support Mehrotra’s optimism that DRAM prices will, in fact, bounce back at some point this year. For Q3, which ends in May, the Street forecasts EPS of $1.26 per share on revenue of $5.42 billion. It remains to be seen whether Micron will guide to meet those estimates or do so in a way to suggest the memory cycle needs more time. From my vantage point, it seems much of the investment risk is now priced into the stock, which trades at just five times forward estimates, compared to a P/E of 18 for the S&P; 500 index, making Micron a compelling play for the next 12 to 18 months.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 20, 2019, 08:08:07 AM EDT",Micron (MU) 2nd Quarter Earnings: What to Expect

Finally, Hastings had a bit of a surprising answer when asked   about attempts to increase regulation of technology companies.   ""We are really mostly a content company powered by tech,"" he   said, arguing that Netflix nowadays was spending substantially   more on content than on technology.

""Apple is a great company,"" Hastings said. However,   Netflix    wanted to control its experience within its own app, which is why   it wasn't working with Apple. ""We have chosen not to integrate   into their services."" Apple is widely expected to give the world a   first look    at its still-unannounced video service at a press event on its   Cupertino campus early next week. In addition to featuring some   of its own original shows, Apple is expected to also resell other   subscription services like Starz and Showtime as part of its   service, much like Amazon does with its Channels video   subscription marketplace. Netflix's decision to abstain from Apple's service is not much   of a surprise to industry insiders: The company has traditionally   been extremely protective of its own app experience, and also   isn't part of Amazon Channels, or Roku's video subscription   marketplace. During a 30-minute Q&A with reporters from around the   world, Hastings also tackled a number of other topics, including   his view of the competitive landscape. Asked how Netflix can   compete with companies like Apple and Amazon that clearly have a   lot more money to spend, Hastings quipped: ""With difficulty."" He added that his company had been competing with Amazon in   streaming ever since both companies first launched online video   services some 15 years ago. ""You do your best job when you have   great competitors,"" he said. But Hastings also had to admit that   the increased competition has a direct impact on Netflix's   expenses.

71,"Chris Helgren (Reuters) This morning, the executives at Lyft (LYFT) began their tour around the major companies of Wall Street, looking for investors in their upcoming IPO. I have, in the past, laid out a case here as to why IPOs, and high-profile IPOs in particular, can be a minefield for individual investors. Very often, the publicity creates a degree of interest that results in excessive demand, sometimes almost regardless of value at the launch, that results in an initial surge in price to unsustainable levels. It is then better to wait for the pullback from the initial highs before jumping in, but for several reasons, Lyft may be a different story. Ignoring for now what followed after these companies went public: the “jump and drop” pattern following an initial offering has held true in most well-publicized initial tech offerings, from Facebook (FB), through Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP), with a whole host in between. There are, however, two big differences with Lyft; the potential of the company and the current attitude of institutional investors. From a potential perspective, the LYFT launch is in many ways more like that of Facebook than any that has come since. Lyft, like Facebook, is the first company to go public in what is a truly disruptive industry. At the time of their IPO, there were a lot of questions about Facebook: How would they monetize their popularity? Could they prevail against a host of competitors? How could they justify such a huge valuation? People were wary of the concept after witnessing the rapid rise and even more rapid demise of MySpace, and Facebook was already in a battle for supremacy in the social media space with Twitter. What Mark Zuckerberg’s company showed in the ensuing years was that the assumptions regarding the overall popularity of social media that underlaid all of those questions were way off the mark. There turned out to be plenty of room for multiple platforms and massive demand from users. Growth, both in terms of users and revenue, was explosive. Still, the doubts were there and after reaching $45 on its first day of trading, FB fell to $17.55 over the next few months. Obviously, even after the recent problems, it was the drop, not the initial surge that was the mistake, and investors are all too aware of that. From a competitive perspective too, now is an ideal time for LYFT’s IPO. The problems that have beset their big rival Uber are being addressed and will probably fade from the public consciousness soon, but their presence now may limit, or even eliminate, the post-IPO dip that has been so typical in the past. That is why those who are saying that Lyft is overvalued at or around the proposed $62-68 offering price are missing the point. You can argue that is the case based on a normal multiple of revenue, but this is not a normal industry. The pace of acceptance of ride-sharing as a concept has been so rapid that it is hard to estimate the potential total market but, as with social media, the likelihood is that what estimates there are will turn out to be way too low. The other thing that has changed is the attitude of institutional investors to losses in a disruptive company like Lyft. Amazon (AMZN) changed the game in that regard, and it is only relatively recently that they have shown what can happen when the switch is turned on. Every trade or investment involves a risk/reward calculation and AMZN’s recent profitability has skewed the reward side of that equation to such an extent that in some cases big losses are no longer as scary as they were just a few years ago. A full analysis of the value of the LYFT stock at issuance is, of course, impossible right now as we don’t know what the offering price will be. What we can do though, even at this stage, is assess the potential for long-term growth and the likely attitude of the market to the stock. On both of those fronts, LYFT looks at this early stage to be a winner. If you have an opportunity to participate at the offer price, therefore, it makes sense to do so, but unlike in several recent cases, doing that in order to bank a quick profit may not be the best strategy.",Martin Tillier,"March 18, 2019, 01:13:03 PM EDT",A Preview of the Lyft (LYFT) IPO
72,"Shutterstock photo With advancements in medicine, the prevention of epidemics, and better nutrition, the rise of the human population has become pronounced. The same cannot be said for animals. Humans continue to exert pressure not just on natural resources but also on wildlife. In fact, the figures in the population of wildlife portray a grim picture. Illicit activities such as poaching and wildlife trafficking are pushing endangered species closer to extinction. While the efforts made by international organizations and government authorities are on, a lot more needs to be done before it’s too late. Here’s how advanced technology is being leveraged to combat such illegal activities. The problem is grave An estimate in the 2018 Living Planet Report by the WWF International suggests that the global population of vertebrate animals has fallen by almost 60% since 1970 (1970-2014). At the London 2018 Illegal Wildlife Trade conference, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt shared some dismal numbers: “Forty years ago, Africa had about 1.3 million elephants. Today, the figure is down by two thirds to 415,000. In Asia, the population of wild tigers has dropped by 95% since 1900.” Different species of wildlife are poached for different reasons—elephants for ivory, rhinoceros for horns, tigers and leopards for skin, and iguanas are caught for the pet trade, among others. The demand for ivory, which is seen as a symbol of status and wealth, continues to remain high, a primary factor leading to devastating poaching across regions such as Africa. It is estimated that at least 33,000 elephants are killed each year for their tusks in the African continent alone. Not just elephants -- rhino poaching rose by 7,700% in South Africa during 2007 to 2013. By one estimate, illegal wildlife trafficking is the fourth most profitable crime in the world, after drugs, humans, and arms, generating as much as $23 billion. A solution in technology may help to reduce the menace of poaching By using deep network algorithms, it is possible to detect human and vehicle presence with high degree of accuracy to ‘sound alerts.’ One such device is RESOLVE’s TrailGuard AI camera which is powered by Intel’s (INTC) tiny yet powerful Intel Movidius Myriad2 VPU, which delivers visual intelligence to the camera itself, resulting in several important benefits. The AI technology is being used to detect poachers entering Africa’s wildlife reserves and alert park rangers in near real-time so poachers can be stopped before killing endangered animals. TrailGuard AI will be deployed in 100 reserves in Africa throughout 2019, starting with Serengeti and Garamba in partnership with the National Geographic Society and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. There are plans to expand to Southeast Asia and South America. The authorities at the 37,000 hectares Welgevonden Game Reserve in South Africa are collaborating with IBM (IBM) to harness cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics technologies to combat the poaching of endangered rhinos. Collars with embedded sensors that are placed on typical preyed-upon animals, including zebra, wildebeest, eland and impala, leaving out the rhinos. The information via sensors related to location, movement pattern, direction and average speed of travel of these animals is monitored and studied. The data collected is being used to create algorithms, built on the prey-animals’ response to perceived threats to making poaching predictable, and thus preventable. Meanwhile Microsoft (MSFT) with its AI for Earth initiative has been giving grants to projects that use artificial intelligence for building a sustainable future. Traditionally, analysts spend hours and hours studying thousands of images taken from satellites, drones or camera traps in the wild to decipher range, populations, and behaviors of animals otherwise rarely seen by humans. It is laborious work. This is one area where advanced technologies such as deep learning is making a difference. A Microsoft AI solution is accelerating the process with a machine learning model that can identify snow leopards and automatically classify hundreds of thousands of photos in a matter of minutes. The Elephant Listening Project and Wild Me are some other Microsoft backed AI projects for wildlife conservation. In response to the aggressive poaching activities in Africa, Vulcan, Inc. developed EarthRanger. Vulcan, Inc. describes itself as the engine behind philanthropist and Microsoft cofounder Paul G. Allen's network of organizations and initiatives. Vulcan’s EarthRanger is a software platform that collects information on activity in a protected area using digital radios, animal collars and vehicle tracking. All such information was previously housed on separate devices creating disconnects. EarthRanger integrates it all into a single one-stop data hub. The platform also adds ranger observations such as snare traps, animal carcasses and footsteps. One single stop for all data enables quicker analysis and proactively intercepts poaching activity. The EarthRanger is deployed in a multiple location across Africa. The illicit wildlife trade is a primary reason that many species are endangered, and these activities are a part of a bigger network These crimes are orchestrated by sophisticated criminal networks that smuggle guns, people, and drugs. While a lot needs to be done to curb these heinous crimes, the deployment of advanced technologies is a positive step forward.",Prableen Bajpai,"March 18, 2019, 10:36:27 AM EDT","How Advanced Technology Can Help Save Wildlife, And The Companies Behind Them"

74,"Google    is set to   unveil its take on the future of gaming    at the Game Developers Conference (   GDC    ) in San Francisco next week. Little is known about   Google    's plans, with speculation ranging from a cloud gaming service to   a full-fledged game console. However, patents filed by the   company, code snippets, and other clues suggest that the service   may be closely tied to another key Google product: its      Chromecast    streaming adapter. Ahead of a Tuesday press event, Google has been hinting that   its video game plans include a hardware component. Most notably,   the company   launched a placeholder page    on the Google Store, which it uses to sell its own phones, smart   speakers, and streaming devices. What's more, a recently   unearthed   patent shows a game controller    , featuring a microphone button for access to the Google   Assistant. Google did not respond to a request for comment.makeArticleAd(); We also know that Google has been experimenting with a cloud   gaming service. Called Project Stream, the service   allowed users to play ""Assassin's Creed   Odyssey""    without installing it on their PCs, simply streaming it from   Google's servers. The product, to be unveiled next week, is   expected to combine both new gaming hardware as well as the cloud   streaming service. How all of this may fit together was first described in a   patent recently granted to the company for   ""independent control of interactive streaming   media.""    That patent, which Google first applied for back in 2015, lists   some of the key people behind Google's   Chromecast    streaming media player as inventors, including Google Home VP   Rishi Chandra, former Google Home Hardware design director   Michael Sundermeyer, and Chromecast engineering team lead Majd   Bakar. On the surface, the patent seems to be all about remote media   control, similar to the way Chromecast works, with references to   ""a simple video decoding device"" without ""physical interfaces for   accepting human input."" But dig into the details, and take a look   at the illustrations, and it quickly becomes clear that this is   all about gaming. From the patent: ""In one non-limiting example, a mobile device can establish a   streaming session in a cloud-based gaming environment. (…) In   some implementations, a user can access streaming media (e.g., an   online game, video, application, etc.) on her display device   (e.g., a television) through a media player connected to the   display device and the Internet. (…) Once the session is   established, the user may put away her mobile device and pick up   the game controller (paired/connected to her mobile device) and   begin playing the game over the streaming media session."" In other words: Users may pick and launch a cloud-based game   from their phone, cast it to their TV, and then use a game   controller to play it. The idea that Google would use Chromecast to launch its gaming   service is not new.   The Information    reported in early 2018 that the company had been working on a   cloud-based video game streaming service internally called   ""Yeti,"" which had originally been developed to run on Chromecast.   Tha   t report    indicated that development eventually shifted to a dedicated   video game console, but a number of clues suggest that there is   still some connection to Chromecast.  9to5Google discovered in September    that Google developers had referenced ""Yeti folks"" in comments on   an open source component of Chromecast's code, suggesting that   the team working on Google's gaming service was pushing for   low-latency video streaming on Google's TV dongle. But the link appears even deeper.   Variety    discovered this week that the gaming service is already   referenced in the code running on Google's Chromecast. Javascript   code used to generate the home screen for every Chromecast   streaming adapter currently in circulation includes a mention of   a ""mockYetiStreamingService.""  In Chromecast's home screen / backdrop code: A Yeti     streaming service reference.  To be fair, all of this does not mean that Google's gaming   service will actually be based on its Chromecast hardware. Google   has integrated Chromecast technology into most of its recent   hardware products, including its Google Home smart speakers, its   Home Hub display, and its Android TV streaming platform that is   being used by a variety of smart TV manufacturers. It would only   make sense that Google would add casting technology to, or even   rely on the technology to power, any upcoming video game   console. However, Google released a   third-generation model of its Chromecast   streaming adapter in October    . In addition to a few advertised hardware changes, the new   hardware also includes better Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth   support - both features necessary to use Chromecast for gaming.   Google spokespeople at the time declined to comment on those   features. And here's one more curious tidbit: When Google invited media   and industry representatives to Tuesday's unveil, it did so under   the tagline ""Gather around."" The fact that Google's Chromecast   adapter has a round shape could be pure coincidence … or suggest   that Google's gaming hardware may have been hiding in plain sight   for months.

To be fair, all of this does not mean that Google's gaming   service will actually be based on its Chromecast hardware. Google   has integrated Chromecast technology into most of its recent   hardware products, including its Google Home smart speakers, its   Home Hub display, and its Android TV streaming platform that is   being used by a variety of smart TV manufacturers. It would only   make sense that Google would add casting technology to, or even   rely on the technology to power, any upcoming video game   console. However, Google released a   third-generation model of its Chromecast   streaming adapter in October    . In addition to a few advertised hardware changes, the new   hardware also includes better Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth   support - both features necessary to use Chromecast for gaming.   Google spokespeople at the time declined to comment on those   features. And here's one more curious tidbit: When Google invited media   and industry representatives to Tuesday's unveil, it did so under   the tagline ""Gather around."" The fact that Google's Chromecast   adapter has a round shape could be pure coincidence … or suggest   that Google's gaming hardware may have been hiding in plain sight   for months.

78,"iStock photo It is a tough time for social media. Around the world, people are becoming increasingly aware of the downside of user-created content and blaming the platforms for what is posted there. There is a big-picture philosophical debate to be had there, but it will have to be conducted with the knowledge that the genie is out of the bottle. Social media as a method of communication and news dissemination is not going away, and the big players in the industry are starting to make changes to their platforms to increase accountability and promote accuracy. In addition, though, they are also becoming savvier about increasing engagement. The latest change to Twitter (TWTR)’s platform is a case in point. They are now allowing users of their app to simply swipe to access their phone’s camera to facilitate the posting of pictures and video. To some, that no doubt looks like a belated response to the growth of Instagram and other image-related platforms, but it is being done from a position of strength and addresses something that has been a problem for Twitter in the past: monetization. It is impossible to deny Twitter’s place in society. A huge percentage of news stories now mention Twitter. It is the preferred communication method of everybody from sports stars and journalists to the President of the United States. Since its early days, however, Twitter has faced an inherent contradiction: Its character limit and rapid-fire style mitigates against watching and reacting to advertising. Increased video content will go some way toward solving that problem. We have become accustomed to ads at the beginning of online video content and increasingly accepting of them as a price to pay for access to “free” content. Video advertising is already important to the company, accounting for over half their revenue last year, so anything that increases video content has to be a good thing for their bottom line. In its last earnings release and subsequent conference call, Twitter seemed to be positioning itself for this move. They announced a move away from the usual Monthly Active User (MAU) metric and to a new one that they created, monetizable Daily Active Users (mDAUs). This addresses a problem with the old metric; popularity is not necessarily related to profitability. By counting users who can be exposed to advertising, Twitter is confronting that head on and the switch is an indication of a new-found confidence in their ability to excel in that area.  Even so, the stock dropped significantly after those earnings, largely due to a disappointing revenue forecast, and has stayed at those lower levels as the broader market recovered this year. That is hardly surprising as analysts will have adjusted their expectations accordingly, but now that all that is baked in, the future for the stock looks good. The trailing and forward P/Es of around 20 and 30 respectively don’t scream value but, given how Twitter only began focusing on monetization relatively recently, growth, even in a difficult environment for social media, is a reasonable expectation. That is why the stock’s PEG ratio, which factors that in, is at a very attractive 0.82 (a reading below 1 is considered positive for a stock). For a long time, Twitter focused on user growth and becoming a fixture of modern life above all else, and many, including me I will admit, questioned that at a time when Facebook (FB) and others were monetizing like crazy. Now though, with the benefit of experience in what users find acceptable advertising, they are tweaking their product accordingly and significant gains in the stock look likely as a result.",Martin Tillier,"March 15, 2019, 11:27:53 AM EDT","In Difficult Environment For Social Media, Twitter (TWTR) Still Looks Like A Buy"

80,"Shutterstock photo Deepak Jain, Co-Founder and CEO, Swych Blockchain Labs “I need the perfect gift for her!” We’ve all yearned to come up with an awesome gift for an upcoming anniversary or birthday that our loved one would love, fits her taste perfectly, she doesn’t have it already, and it won’t gather dust in a drawer somewhere. Perhaps she would like that sweater she is eyeing, but can I pick the perfect color or size? Or maybe she would like last season’s hot book, but has she already read it? The gift card is a great option but, like any millennial, she hates receiving plastic cards. How often has she received one for a shop with no outlets nearby, for a store that sells clothes she hates, or for a restaurant whose food she finds inedible! Since gift cards represent roughly $130 billion of sales a year, chances are this happens in every household. Could a misunderstood technology, blockchain, solve this perennial problem? Blockchain is a young technology, but it’s already been employed or considered for a wide variety of uses. This “distributed ledger technology” uses computer networks to render information verifiable, unfalsifiable, and immutable. Because all the points of the network must agree about the system’s data, there’s no single point of failure at which a bad actor may introduce fraudulent information. This resistance to manipulation makes blockchain ideal for transferring value between different states. How does this apply to the gift card market? Like VHS tapes, CDs, DVDs, MP3 players, alarm clocks, and boarding passes before, plastic gift cards are poised to be relegated to history with a smarter, faster, theft/fraud-resistant, and more personal digital reincarnation. Some current limitations imposed on card use may serve to protect users—their gift is theirs, and shouldn’t be stolen by an anonymous hacker hundreds or thousands of miles away—yet the rules governing redemption still frustrate and disappoint. A blockchain makes fraud functionally impossible and renders such onerous rules unnecessary. Suppose you have a globetrotting friend or family member overseas and you’d like to send them something personal. Suppose further you’ve forgotten their birthday and are only reminded when you see a social media alert. You could send them money, but in addition to being impersonal, most conventional wire services include delays between sending and receiving a payment. This even applies to direct deposit, and, besides, how many friends’ foreign bank account numbers do you know? Sending physical gifts or even plastic gift cards across the border is not an ideal solution because of shipping costs, potential delays, and the dreaded risk of the gift not arriving on time! A digital solution though, now that is the perfect answer. Gift cards are essentially methods of value transfer, but they’re safer than cash. Because they can only be used at the intended retailer, it becomes very difficult for money launderers to take advantage. A digital solution on blockchain can make the gift card even safer. With smart ways to identify both the sender and the recipient as they interact with the system through mobile apps or websites, we can weed out hackers and fraudsters. By tracking and analyzing each transaction on the blockchain, it becomes possible to identify possible misuse and install countermeasures. Being able to reconcile every dollar on the blockchain through automatic settlements can reduce costs and delays. In cases like this, blockchain makes the difficult easy and the impossible possible. Would the users of a blockchain gift program need to understand the technology? The concepts underlying blockchain, involving as they do sophisticated mathematics and computer science, can be difficult to explain, and this complexity often makes blockchain projects daunting. Thankfully, using a gifting program would require no special knowledge. Just as you can navigate the web without understanding HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), you could send, transfer, and transform gifts without once hearing the phrase “blockchain.” There are few worse things than being thought ungrateful: You wouldn’t want your loving aunt to know that her conception of your gift taste is off. Though blockchain might allow a convenient switch, there’s nothing in a blockchain transaction that would alert the gift-giver that their recipient has transformed their gift to one retailer into credit to spend at another retailer they preferred. So rest assured: Your heartfelt thank-you note to your aunt would be honest. Gift card redemption could represent one of the first mainstream and consumer-accessible implementations of the blockchain. The thought behind the gift will continue to count, but the days of plastic gift cards and dissatisfied recipients will be passed. That will be a day to celebrate.",Guest Contributors,"March 14, 2019, 03:49:27 PM EDT",Could Digital Gifting Be The First Mainstream Consumer Use Case For Blockchain?

82,"maybefalse for Getty images Alibaba Cloud lies at the heart of Alibaba’s (BABA) robust ecosystem. Its cloud computing arm, known as Alibaba Cloud, was established in 2009, and is now counted among the top echelon of cloud players globally and is emerging as the powerhouse for the company. Alibaba has transformed from an e-commerce player to a leader in the technology and digital economy spaces, making cloud computing an integral part of Alibaba’s long-term strategy. Here’s a closer look at Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba’s cloud computing revenue grew 84% year-over-year to $962 million during the December 2018 quarter. Alibaba Cloud has increased its paying customers at a rapid pace; it has more than one million paying consumers globally. Since it's IPO in 2014, there have been constant comparisons between Alibaba and Amazon.com. The rising importance of Alibaba Cloud (or Aliyun) adds to another point on that list. AWS, the cloud computing arm of Amazon is presently the undisputed leader in this segment and while Amazon has a strong core business, AWS has been a significant 10% to Amazon’s overall business revenue. Likewise, Aliyun is gradually increasing its share in Alibaba’s revenue pie; in Q2 2015, its share was 1.5% which has now moved up to 6%. Alibaba Cloud is still in an absorbing phase where investments made are yet to reap profits. In the past quarter, Adjusted EBITA was a loss of $40 million. Alibaba Cloud is expanding at a fast pace and once its services build scale, its potential would start to reflect in Alibaba’s bottom line. In November 2018, Alibaba Cloud became the first-ever Chinese company to be included in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems. It is already a part of the Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data Management Solutions for Analytics. Alibaba Cloud ranked fourth on the list of worldwide cloud infrastructure market with a 4% share in 2018 growing at 91.8% vis-à-vis 2017. AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are ahead of Alibaba Cloud. In the APAC region, Alibaba ranked second in terms of public IaaS and PaaS service revenues. The robustness of Alibaba Cloud was proved yet again during its busiest business day of the year—the Global Shopping Festival 2018, which recorded $30.8 billion sales in 24 hours. Alibaba strongly believes that computing power is the key to applying advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to businesses. During the Cloud Computing Conference 2018 in Hangzhou, Alibaba said it was establishing a chip company, a subsidiary under the Alibaba Group that will “focus on customized AI chips and embedded processors to further support Alibaba’s growing cloud and Internet of Things businesses, as well as to provide intelligent solutions for different industries.” Alibaba Cloud is enhancing its presence footprint in newer markets. Alibaba Cloud has a growing network of data centers across countries and regions, including India, Indonesia, Dubai, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Germany, the U.S. and UK. While Alibaba Cloud is gradually expanding its global footprint, it is already the undisputed leader in China with a 43% share in public cloud market in 2018. It is estimated that, “roughly 40% of the top 500 enterprises and 50% of listed companies in China are using Alibaba Cloud.” During 2018, Alibaba Cloud entered into collaborations with a number of universities for various projects including the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the University of Macau, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, the engineering school Télécom ParisTech and National University of Singapore. Alibaba Cloud expanded its Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering to major global markets including South East Asia, the U.S and Europe. Alibaba Cloud's BaaS supports enterprise-level blockchain applications on the two platforms of Hyperledger Fabric and Ant Blockchain. It launched the superconducting quantum computing cloud in collaboration with Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), featuring a quantum processor with 11 quantum bits (qubits) of power. New partnerships were entered with Bosch, Commvault, InterContinental Hotels Group, VMware, Siemens, Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife of the Republic of Kenya, SAP and KPMG, among others. At the Mobile World Congress in February 2019, Alibaba released seven new solutions, and two new features for the international markets. The launch comes after its proven in-house usage across various businesses within the Alibaba Group, including retail, fintech, logistics, media and entertainment, digital branding and marketing. In future, almost every business would rely on cloud in some form, creating a huge demand. The worldwide public cloud services market is projected to reach $278.3 billion by 2021 from $175.8 billion in 2018. Alibaba Cloud has immense potential to offer proven, scalable, and secure technologies to customers world over and is thus emerging as a strong player among the global hyperscale cloud providers. Its importance for Alibaba is reflected in the statement by Daniel Zhang, CEO, Alibaba Group, “Our growth is driven by the power of Alibaba’s cloud and data technology that helps expedite the digital transformation of millions of enterprises.”",Prableen Bajpai,"March 14, 2019, 02:03:36 PM EDT",Alibaba Cloud Lies At The Heart Of BABA'S Business Strategy

""We did zero PR whatsoever,"" Beck said. ""We didn't expect that   it would blow up that crazy."" Beat Games also announced the release of its first song pack   Thursday. Dubbed ""Monstercat Music Pack,"" the paid add-on allows   Beat Saber players to add ten new tracks to the game.  As   the name suggests, all of the tracks are from the Canadian EDM   label Monstercat. Beat Saber has become a hit with VR users ever since its   release in May of last year. The game can best be described as a   mixture of ""Fruit Ninja"" and ""Guitar Hero,"" requiring users to   slice squares to the rhythm of the music.  ""It is super intuitive,"" said Beck when asked about the secret   to Beat Saber's success. He also credited the technical chops of   his team for Beat Saber's popularity, saying that the game didn't   crash, and didn't lead to motion sickness. ""The code is super   polished,"" Beck said. Thus far, ""Beat Saber"" has mostly focused on electronic music,   but Beck said that his team was looking to expand the game's   music choices over time to other genres as well.

86,"Shutterstock images When one company buys another, the reaction in the two stocks is usually pretty predictable. When ABC buys XYZ, they pay a premium over XYZ’s market price, so that stock rises to just below the price being paid with the difference reflecting the risk of failure inherent in any announced deal. Stock in the acquiring company tends to move the other way, falling to take account of the massive initial expenditure. So, when both stocks climb on the announcement of a deal, as happened this week when Nvidia (NVDA) announced their buyout of Mellanox (MLNX), investors should take notice. In effect, what the market is saying in a situation like this is that the buyer, in this case Nvidia, got a good deal simply in terms of the price paid, but there are other factors that influence the immediate reaction, such as the fit between the two and the vision for the new company. When those things are considered, this looks like a great deal for Nvidia and even after the jump in NVDA that followed the news, the stock looks like a solid buy.   Not that long ago, Nvidia was a fairly unremarkable maker of video graphics cards for PCs and just three years ago, the stock was trading in the $20s. What nobody imagined back then was that the bet the company had taken on artificial intelligence (AI) would pay off in the way it has. This deal represents the next stage in that bet. Advances in the field have taken the idea of computers that essentially think for themselves from science fiction to an everyday reality, and NVDA's rapid rise reflects the company’s strong position in the market. Mellanox is a world leader in the infrastructure, hardware, and software for servers and data storage. If you have been following business news at all in the last few years, you will know that that too is an area of massive growth, and that there is a seemingly endless demand for the kind of computing power that Nvidia delivers. The strategic fit for these two companies is obvious, and the deal represents a merger of two companies with established profit records and solid free cash flow. Because of that, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s claim that the deal will be immediately accretive to Nvidia’s earnings looks realistic and the synergies will lead to a healthy operating margin. As important as all that is to the initial market reaction to the deal, it is the long-term prospects for the combined business that should excite investors. The digitized world in which we live is awash with data. That creates ethical problems as to who that actually belongs to and what can be done with it, but those problems will be addressed and don’t change the basic fact that the demand for the storage and processing that the new, combined company will service is huge and growing exponentially. That growth is best served by seamless integration throughout, and that is what Nvidia will now be able to provide. The technical picture is also encouraging. As you can see from the second chart above, when the market corrected in Q4 last year, NVDA got hit particularly hard. The stock lost well over fifty percent over those three months as valuation worries added to the fears of the possible effects of a global slowdown and disruption of China/US trade. Now that slide has halted, though, the chart shows an inverted head and shoulders pattern and a recent series of higher lows and higher highs, both of which are extremely bullish. The diversification that comes from this deal should limit extreme reactions to market conditions such as we saw on that drop in the future and, with a good technical setup being a short-term plus and the combined company having a huge market share in one of the fastest growing businesses there is, NVDA looks cheap at these levels.",Martin Tillier,"March 14, 2019, 10:35:19 AM EDT","In A Buyout, When The Buyer's Stock Rises, Investors Should Pay Attention"

""Univision has been a pioneer in Latin music,"" said Univision   Radio president Jesus Lara in an interview with   Variety    this week. However, Lara admitted that Univision didn't have a   good track record of coordinating its efforts across TV, local   radio and online.

""The Hispanic   marketplace is a complex one,"" he said, with Cuban-Americans   preferring different tunes than music fans with a Mexican or   Guatemalan heritage. Napster CEO Bill Patrizio argued that the Spotify's and Apple   Music's of this world were often missing those nuances, and in   turn ignoring Univision's audience. ""They are poorly served by   today's mainstream music services,"" he said. Uforia's promise to Hispanic music fans is to go deep. ""We   contextualize the programming,"" said Lara, citing the recent   International Women's Day as an example. For that day, Uforia's   curators created a number of playlists, including one of   women-only Mariachi bands, and one of female Reggaeton   artists. And there is another difference between Uforia and Spotify, or   Apple Music for that matter. Univision's music app is free for   all, with no upsell to a paid plan. ""My audience is accustomed to   and doesn't mind the advertising for a free service,"" said Lara,   adding that his company currently had no plans for a paid   tier. ""Not all roads lead to $9.99 a month,"" agreed Patrizio. He   likened today's streaming market to a pre-internet world, when   record labels focused on CDs, and tried to sell the same product   for the same price point to everyone. ""It's inevitable that we   are going to see greater segmentation,"" he said.

""We will not become some nameless,   faceless white label provider that no one has ever heard of,"" he   said. As for Uforia, the revamped app with a Napster-powered music   streaming experience is available for iOS and Android now.

92,"By Landon Manning IBM (IBM) is teaming up with a group of credit unions based in Denver, Colorado, to pursue the integration of blockchain technology. Forbesdescribed some of the specifics surrounding this plan, which will see IBM and CULedger offer blockchain-based services “to help credit unions provide their members with greater efficiencies and an enhanced user experience.” CULedger has an international reach with credit unions in several nations worldwide. The main thrust of this plan is to create an immutable audit trail using blockchain technology “to create new business models and transform existing business processes for credit unions.” Considering the borderless nature of blockchains, this initiative pairs up nicely with CULedger’s stated goal of reaching users abroad. Forbes noted that the total assets of credit unions worldwide are valued at nearly $2 trillion. Last December, CULedger got its first serious taste of enterprise blockchain software when it became a part of R3’s decentralized ecosystem. Running apps on its Corda distributed ledger, R3 has made several attempts to transform the distributed ledger technology space with enterprise applications. This new partnership with IBM should provide CULedger with greatly expanded potential for working with overseas credit unions. Currently, IBM also operates live blockchain projects across “financial services, supply chain, government, retail, digital rights management and healthcare sectors” all around the world. Forbes reported that in the last year and a half, the company has undertaken new initiatives with major companies based in Denmark and China. John Ainsworth, CULedger’s founder and CEO, claimed that a “cooperative model that helps improve the member experience while benefiting all credit unions is the ideal approach to ensuring the next wave of financial innovation.” He added that his company is “creating a network through which all members can join and access new services and enabling credit unions to become even more competitive while addressing new market dynamics where members are demanding even more for their financial services provider. Forbes also described some of the specifics of a new digital identity credential that CULedger will be implementing, called MyCUID. Using blockchain technology to create a self-sovereign identity system, this program will allow users to participate with any member credit unions worldwide.",Bitcoin Magazine,"March 13, 2019, 02:37:37 PM EDT",IBM and CULedger Partner on Enterprise Blockchain Project for Credit Unions

95,"The financial services sector is often viewed as a value proposition, not a destination for investors seeking growth. Fintech is reshaping the growth proposition in the normally staid financial services sector and investors can tap that growth with exchange traded funds (ETFs), such as the Global X FinTech ETF (FINX). FINX debuted in September 2016 and tracks the Indxx Global FinTech Thematic Index. While the ETF is not as seasoned as other traditional financial services funds, FINX reflects the growth opportunities available in the fintech space. For the two years ended March 11, 2019, FINX returned nearly 70 percent, topping the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) by a margin of more than 7-to-1. FINX follows the Indxx Global FinTech Thematic Index and is home to companies looking to “transform established industries like insurance, investing, fundraising, and third-party lending through unique mobile and digital solutions,” according to Global X. Fintech Growth Financial disruptors residing on the FINX roster include Intuit Inc. (INTU), SS&C; Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL). That trio, which combines for over 18 percent of FINX's weight, is up an average of 29.37 percent over the past year. These companies and others FINX components are driving positive change and disruption in everyday financial services. “We’ve reached an inflection point in 'fintech,' where early disrupters are moving from challengers to industry leaders in their own right, as they expand their services, develop their brands, and increase market share,” according to Fortune. Digital payments is one of the primary growth frontiers for the fintech industry, a trend expected to benefit FINX holdings such as PayPal and Square Inc. (SQ). As the chart below indicates, the value of digital payment transactions is expected to undergo exponential growth over the next several years.  (Courtesy: Statista) A Conventional Approach FINX is not a run-of-the-mill financial services ETF, but it is cap-weighted, meaning it uses a conventional weighting methodogy. That means larger fintech companies, such as Intuit and PayPal, command bigger percentages of the ETF's weight while stocks with smaller market values are less prominent on the FINX roster. While some issuers of thematic ETFs eschew cap weighting, FINX investors could be well-served by that weighting scheme. “While some might argue that in the aggregate smaller companies offer higher growth opportunities than larger companies and therefore warrant more exposure than a market cap weighting scheme offers, we do not always find this to be the case in disruptive industries,” according to Global X research. “Using history as our guide, recent powerful themes have demonstrated that larger companies enjoy enormous benefits due to economies of scale and network effects.” The 37 holdings in FINX have weights ranging from 0.13 percent to 6.65 percent. The average market value of those holdings is $13 billion, putting FINX at the lower end of the large-cap spectrum.",Todd Shriber,"March 13, 2019, 11:29:23 AM EDT",A Fantastic Fintech ETF

100," TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Co  Chairman Carlos Ghosn was set to be released on $8.9 million bail on Wednesday after a Tokyo court rejected a last-minute attempt by prosecutors to keep the once-feted executive in prison. Ghosn, a former titan of the global auto industry, has spent more than 100 days detained in a small, unheated room since his Nov. 19 arrest for alleged financial misconduct. The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday granted his release on 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) bail after his lawyers assured the court that Ghosn would submit to extensive surveillance. News of the successful bail request on Tuesday sent hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews racing to the detention centre in eastern Tokyo. Many camped there overnight to secure places for their equipment. Ghosn faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his compensation to the tune of $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade. If convicted on all the charges, he faces up to a decade in jail. The ex-chairman of Nissan, Renault SA  and Mitsubishi Motors Corp  has denied any wrongdoing. ""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday. The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day. Ghosn last month hired lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, nicknamed ""the Razor"" for his success in several high-profile cases, to lead his case. Though the granting of bail represents a significant development, Ghosn still faces a criminal justice system in which only three of every 100 defendants who plead not guilty are acquitted. There is also no plea-bargaining mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.

101," By Saumya Joseph March 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it approved a Johnson & Johnson  nasal spray antidepressant for people resistant to other treatments but placed restrictions on use of the drug, which it warned could be misused and abused. The approval of nasal spray esketamine marks the first new type of treatment for depression in more than 30 years and has raised hopes for its relatively fast action and ability to treat some otherwise unreachable patients. Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly and Co's  Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). ""Spravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,"" said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J's Janssen Research & Development. Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J's pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars. The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA's harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug. Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a .  (graphic). During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico. The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks. However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study. The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide. Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood. J&J's drug helps restore these nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms, according to the company.",,"March 05, 2019, 07:43:00 PM EDT",FDA approves J&J's ketamine-like nasal spray for depression

Phone-based banking is popular in other emerging markets such as China, India and Kenya, and has been driven by user-friendly, affordable apps from private companies.

Prysmian revised up on Tuesday total savings it expected from buying U.S. firm General Cable to 175 million euros ($198 million) from 150 million euros and said it would achieve them by 2021, a year earlier than previously forecast. Prysmian said it was making 95 million euros of provisions for 2018 at WesternLink, a high-voltage cable connection from Scotland to England. ""The adverse effects generated by the WesternLink provisions were mainly offset by the improved margins reported by Telecom and High Voltage Underground, as well as the synergies arising on the integration with General Cable"" the company said. Prysmian had cut its target in June for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) due to additional costs at the WesternLink project.

108," By Ernest Scheyder and Liana B. Baker March 5 (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp's  top shareholder said on Tuesday  the miner should focus on striking a joint venture deal in Nevada with rival Newmont Mining Corp  before considering a full-blown merger. ""My preference is a joint venture,"" Joe Foster of the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund, said in a phone interview. ""I don't flat out oppose a merger. If a merger is the only way to unify Nevada then maybe, just maybe, that's something we might consider. But as it stands the best path right now is to form a JV in Nevada."" Newmont said it prefers a joint venture in the state, a plan Barrick says would be too complicated and not financially beneficial to all shareholders. A Nevada joint venture ""would avoid exposing our investors to the complexity and significant risk that would come with combining the two companies,"" Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said on Tuesday in response to Foster's comments. Barrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Barrick Chief Executive Mark Bristow told Reuters on Monday he was ready to seriously negotiate a Nevada joint venture. Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg were meeting Tuesday in New York to discuss Newmont's proposal for the joint venture, which was unveiled earlier this week, according to sources familiar with the matter. Van Eck owns about 110 million shares of Barrick, or about 6.4 percent of the company, making it the largest shareholder. The fund is also owns about 7 percent of Newmont, making it the third-largest shareholder, with roughly 31 million shares. Foster said he recognized that Bristow and Goldberg were ""miles apart on a JV agreement,"" but urged them to hash out a deal. ""These companies pay these guys a lot of money. They need to find a place in the middle where they can come together and create value for shareholders,"" Foster said. If there is no other way to combine the Nevada properties, a merger is ""one way to create that value."" But Foster said a merger would create a ""monstrous"" gold company.",,"March 05, 2019, 02:02:00 PM EDT",Top Barrick shareholder urges joint venture in Nevada with Newmont

The patented technology is meant to deal with a shortcoming of   traditional speaker systems for VR: They just don't work that   well for spatial audio. ""Audio content that is outputted via static audio devices may   not accurately represent the virtual environment and/or virtual   objects included in the virtual environment,"" the patent reads in   part. ""For example, sounds outputted by stationary speakers may   not accurately reflect the distance, direction, and/or motion   between the user and a virtual object included in the virtual   environment.""makeArticleAd(); As a remedy for this, Harman is looking to map VR soundscapes   to robotic speakers, and then move them around in a room.   According to the patent, this could reproduce a wide range of   acoustic phenomenons, including objects emitting sounds   themselves, as well as walls that sound can bounce off, physical   obstructions that can absorb sound, and more. ""The audio that the user hears matches more closely with user   expectations for the audio based on what the user sees in the   virtual reality content,"" according to the patent. ""Consequently,   the audio facilitates a more immersive virtual reality   experience."" However, the system is not necessarily meant to reproduce   every sound. One example mentioned in the patent is inner   monologue in narrative VR experiences. From the patent: ""Speech   from a character may be more suitable for output via a robotic   speaker (…) than speech corresponding to an inner monologue from   the user representation, because a sense of space and distance is   generally not required for an inner monologue."" The patent goes into some detail about ways to track the   position of robotic speakers in the room, and ways to position   the speakers themselves. Turns out these devices don't   necessarily need to drive around on four wheels, with Harman   researchers envisioning anything from one-wheelers to ""a hovering   mobility platform based on co-axial rotors, multi-rotors (e.g.,   quadcopters), or vertical gas jet based propulsion mobility   platforms."" Does this mean that VR users will soon have an army of speaker   drones buzzing around their heads? Not necessarily. First, it's   worth pointing out that companies patent technologies all the   time that don't end up becoming real products. One could also   make the case that a lot of these issues could be solved much   easier with smart spatial sound and a good pair of   headphones. However, as location-based virtual reality evolves to become a   sort of high-tech amusement park, it's easy to imagine that   companies like The Void may one day not just use physical props,   but also spatially mapped audio playing from real speakers to   create immersive entertainment experiences.

110," By Elizabeth Dilts NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc  said on Tuesday that it is relaxing the dress code for all its employees, a move once considered unimaginable for the Wall Street firm's leagues of monk-shoed partners and bankers in bespoke suits. The new ""firm wide flexible dress code"" was announced in an internal memo, which said the shift was due to ""the changing nature of workplaces generally in favor of a more casual environment."" Historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, Goldman Sachs traditionally required formal business attire. But since 2017, the bank began relaxing its dress code for employees in the technology division and other new digital businesses. This created a divide in the workforce as clear as denim versus pinstripes. Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman has been competing to secure the best employees. Large technology firms and hedge funds often have more relaxed offices and perks. Tuesday's announcement was also meant to bring the bank's traditional policies up to date for its younger workforce. More than 75 percent of Goldman employees are members of the Millennial or Gen Z generations--people born after 1981. The memo did not specify which clothes are or are not appropriate. ""All of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace,"" the memo reads. The memo also reminded employees to dress ""in a manner that is consistent"" with clients' expectations. ""Of course, casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every interaction and we trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard.""

The plans come as the second largest U.S. airline seeks to grow internationally, though Bastian said at a conference that the company had not yet decided whether to invest in struggling Italian carrier Alitalia. Delta is ""very interested"" and in discussions with Boeing about its proposed new midsized airplane, known as the NMA, Bastian said. Boeing will decide in 2020 whether to produce the plane which industry sources say would have two aisles and seat seven across. The plane aims to address the so-called middle of the jet market between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle and long-distance widebody planes.

121,"Getty images Tesla (TSLA) shareholders have experienced a bumpy ride so far in 2019. With the stock down more than 14% year to date, compared with an 11% rise in the S&P; 500 index, the market has seemingly voted against the company’s decision to cut the price of its flagship Model 3 sedan. But are we missing the big picture? On Friday the stock dropped almost 9% after the company announced late Thursday it would offer a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan. Not only did this news come several months before initially planned, Tesla also said it would close many of its retail stores worldwide. This news comes off the heels of the first batch of February delivery estimates, which — to some observers — weren’t as robust as they could be when compared to fourth quarter 2018 deliveries. What really upset investors, however, was the significant price cuts for all Tesla models. Which is understandable, given the company’s continued need to raise capital. In a conference call with CNBC, CEO Elon Musk didn’t try to hide this fact, telling investors that the company would not turn a profit in the first quarter, but expected a return to profitability in the second quarter. Tesla shares closed Monday at $285.36, losing almost 10% just in the past thirty days. This could be a good buying opportunity, however. Making the Model 3 more affordable and thus more mainstream, has been the point all along in enabling Tesla to compete with the likes for Ford (F) and General Motors (GM). For that to happen, it required a radical shift in the company’s strategy. One of the ways to achieve this, Tesla said it was shifting sales entirely online, which explains why it opted to close many of its retail stores, which the Musk says will become “information centers.” “Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing is to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,” Musk noted in a blog post. These steps, in my estimation, are designed to do two things: First, as we have learned from Apple (AAPL), online orders is a great way to post demand. Second, and perhaps, most important, Tesla will also be able to cut massive overhead costs. Tesla recognizes the cars literally sell themselves. It doesn’t need salespeople to explain features that can be conveyed on a website or phone app. The company said the speed of the new $35,000 version, which can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, would top out at 130 miles per hour. But for only $2,000 more, customers can get a Model 3 that with a range of 240 miles and a top speed of 140 mph. ""This is a game changer,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""Especially at this juncture when they're going through such a difficult period as the EV tax credit rolls off in the U.S., this is really exactly what the doctor ordered."" Sure, the company must be able to execute on this strategy.

126,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell Monday. The software-as-a-service and cloud giant is expected to report a monster quarter, if you listen to the words of co-CEO Keith Block. Salesforce’s customer relationship management services are a must-have for many companies looking to add capabilities such as sales, marketing, e-commerce and analytics. “Companies across every industry, in every geography have a mandate to digitally transform their businesses and are turning to Salesforce as a strategic partner,” Block said in prepared statements last quarter. But strong revenue and earnings growth projections are par for the course for the enterprise cloud giant, which has topped or matched the Street’s earnings estimates in eighteen straight quarters. When the numbers are officially released, the only question is, how high can Salesforce stock fly? Shares are trading at 52-week highs and have risen 20% year to date, crushing the 11% rise in the S&P; 500 index. And yet there are reasons to suspect the stock might actually be cheap. The company’s projected earnings growth rate is 27.5% annually over the next five years. And this is despite the industry being highly competitive, where rivals such as Adobe (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL) are growing market share. As such, Salesforce’s guidance and its billings forecast will be the most closely-watched aspects of Monday’s report. For the quarter that ended January, Wall Street expects the San Francisco-based company to earn 50 cents per share on revenue of $3.37 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 39 cents per share on revenue of $2.68 billion. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 93% year over year to $2.61 per share, while revenue of $13.24 billion would mark a 26.3% increase year over year. Global expansion continues to be one of the main drivers of the company’s growth. Businesses of all sizes and industries recognize the need for a digital transformation. Salesforce’s ability to offer integrated solutions, combined with strategic partnerships with titans like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL) has given it a key competitive advantage in terms of its international reach. In the third quarter, revenues from Europe and Asia Pacific jumped 31% and 26%, respectively, outpacing the 25% rise in the Americas. Those are good signs that Salesforce is growing revenue to an extent that can offset saturation fears in the U.S. On Monday Wall Street will look to see if these trends can continue. And investors will be watching to see to what extent the company can realistically achieve its goal of reaching revenue of $20 billion by 2022.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 04, 2019, 07:58:41 AM EDT",Salesforce (CRM) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect
127,"Chris Helgren - Reuters Getting a ride to anywhere in the United States has never been easier since the arrival of Lyft (LYFT) and Uber, whose long-term mission is to end car ownership. These two rivals, arguably, helped usher in what is called the sharing economy — a community where consumers have access to or can provide goods and services to others (whether free or for a fee) via an on-line platform. For Lyft, which got its start as a college carpooling service called Zimride in 2007, will beat its rival to the public market. On Friday, Lyft filed IPO documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is set to become the first app-based ride-hail company to go public. Lyft, which will list on Nasdaq under the ticker “LYFT,” aims to raise as much as $100 million in its IPO — a figure that’s likely to change, based on investor demand. And given the recent successes of Spotify (SPOT), there’s a strong chance that demand for Lyft — a so-called unicorn — will be high, especially given the company’s recent achievements. In its IPO documents, Lyft said its U.S. market share as of December 2018 reached 39%. That 39% figure marks a 17 percentage-point increase from the 22% it had in December 2016. The company, which had 18.6 million “Active Riders” and over 1.1 million drivers for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, attributed the tremendous share growth to securing not only new riders and drivers, but also more frequent rides from existing customers. But here’s the thing: Despite these impressive numbers, Lyft has lost nearly $2.3 billion over the past three years. Its net loss climbed to $911 million in 2018, up from $688 million in 2017, prompting some criticism on Wall Street. To be fair, Lyft is not the only tech company to have adopted the strategy of “if we build it, they will come.” Both Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) has made investors rich by betting on themselves. Sure, Lyft’s losses are important to keep note of. And the company has disclosed that fact among its risk factors, stating ""we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.” But for some context, Uber has reported losses for of more than $8 billion since it was founded nine years ago, including losing more than $1 billion on revenue of $2.95 billion in the most-recent quarter, according to The Wall Street Journal. I won’t ignore that Lyft, which has been aggressively courting riders by heavily discounting its fares, potentially faces a long road towards profitability. But burning through cash in the early days of a startup in order to gain market share is nothing new. As noted, both Amazon and Netflix, which sought to disrupt existing industries, lost billions for years and experienced tons of speed bumps before turning a profit. It’s something Tesla (TSLA) is now experiencing as well. So how will Lyft be greeted when it officially begins trading? That remains to be seen. But I would put Lyft stock at the top of the list of IPOs with billion-dollar valuations that investors are (or should be) eager to jump into, including yours truly.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 04, 2019, 07:56:07 AM EDT",Lyft (LYFT) Beats Uber To IPO: What to Expect

131," While robots have been a fantastical part of sci-fi Hollywood movies over the years, whether it's Arnold as the Terminator or the various machines of the Matrix, they are now much closer to reality, and more useful. Robots are fast becoming a part of the world around us, helping as assistants for elderly care, providing support in medical procedures and surgeries, carrying out cumbersome and risky processes in mines and industries, and much more. Here’s a look at the robotic revolution and how investors can invest in this space. IDC forecasts that the worldwide spending on robotics systems and drones will be $115.7 billion in 2019 (robotic systems alone at $103.4 billion) and is expected to reach $210.3 billion by 2022. Another report estimates that the revenue in the global robotics market would touch $147.26 billion by the end of 2025, growing at a 17.4% CAGR between 2017-2015. While the projected numbers vary, they reflect the same trend. The world robotics report shows that a new record high of 381,000 units of industrial robots were shipped globally in 2017 and is expected to reach about 630,000 units by 2021. The annual sales volume of industrial robots increased by 114% over the last five years (2013-2017). The sales value was at $16.2 billion in 2017 vis-à-vis 2016. China, Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and Germany are the biggest market for industrial robots. Meanwhile, the sale of service robots increased by 85% during 2017 while there was a 39% increase in sales value. The service robots segment includes both professional (use in logistics, medical) and personal use robots. While robotics is enhancing productivity and competitiveness, there is an uneasiness regarding its impact on the manual job market. Many reports and scholars have painted a dark picture on the rise of robotics. While some fears are justified, there is equal or more evidence to the contrary. A report by IFR reads, “automation does not lead to job substitution, but rather to a reallocation of both jobs and tasks in which robots complement and augment human labor by performing routine or dangerous tasks.” Further, an MIT technology review highlights how “humans and robots collaborating efficiently can be more productive than teams made of either humans or robots alone with a 85% reduction in human idle time.” The use of robotics is said to be a great boon for manufacturing. In October 2018, a BCG report underlined that the U.S. urgently needs a more aggressive approach to developing and adopting robotic technologies for manufacturing, to increase its competitiveness and to boost its economy. “Robotics will drive productivity enhancements, to compensate for a labor shortage and to counteract declining productivity growth. And a thriving domestic robotics industry will enhance America’s global competitiveness during a period of intensifying trade conflict,” read the report. Investing Opportunities For those looking to invest in robotics, there are two broader options. The first is to invest in companies that make robots or its components; some of the companies operating in the field of robotics include, among others: The second way is to invest via exchange traded funds (ETFs). ETFs provide a cost-efficient, transparent and convenient access to investing across companies and geographies. Here are some of the ETFs focused on robotics and artificial intelligence: Launched in 2013, ROBO Global Robotics & Automation ETF (ROBO) was the first robotics and automation ETF providing investors access to rapidly evolving robotics, automation and AI companies across 14 nations. It has a portfolio of 94 companies with less than 20% allocation towards the top ten stock holdings which include FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR), Brooks Automation, Inc. (BRKS), Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG), Aervironment, Inc. and FANUC Corp. The ETF has $1.36 billion as assets under management (AUM) and its geographical portfolio is weighted towards the U.S. and Japan. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) launched in 2016 provides exposure to companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) across industries. The ETF has $1.5 billion as assets under management and tracks the Indxx Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index. The top five stock holdings—Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Keyence Corp. (KYCCF), Mitsubishi Electric Corp., ABB Ltd, and Fanuc Corp (FANUY)—add to 36.13% while 60.13% of the portfolio is concentrated in the top ten stocks. Next is the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (IRBO). It tracks an index composed of developed and emerging market companies that could benefit from the long-term growth and innovation in robotics technologies and artificial intelligence. The ETF has the highest exposure to the U.S. and China in terms of geographical composition. Launched in 2018, the ETF has a portfolio of 97 holdings with 29.59 million as assets under management. The top ten stock holdings have a 15.05% allocation with Cloudera, Inc. (CLDR), Snap Inc Class A (SNAP), Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC), iQIYI, Inc.(IQ) and Stratasys Ltd (SSYS) as the top five stocks. Launched in 2018, First Trust NASDAQ Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (ROBT) tracks the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Index which is composed of companies engaged in the artificial intelligence and robotics segment of the technology, industrial, medical and other economic sectors. The Index includes “companies in artificial intelligence or robotics that are classified as either enablers, engagers or enhancers.” The ETF has a geographical exposure is tilted towards the U.S. and Japan and has Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), iRobot Corporation, ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) as its top stock holdings. The top ten stocks have a 23.28% allocation. Final word Overall, the rise of robotics and artificial intelligence is revolutionizing multiple industries, and this is creating immense investing opportunities. The above listed ETFs are an efficient and convenient mechanism to investors to benefit from the shift that's underway. ETF details based on factsheets.

140,"Dell Technologies (DELL) is set to release fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results after Thursday’s closing bell. Investors are eager to see what the tech giant reveals in its first quarterly results since it returned to the public market last December. And a good return it has been. Shares of the PC and data-storage giant have climbed 15% year to date, including 20% gains over the past month and besting the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P; 500 index. The company, which has three key operating segments, is benefiting from a combination of factors — namely its improved revenue in its Client Solutions Group and Infrastructure Solutions Group. Dell is also seeing market share gains in its PC division. Notably, this is despite Gartner reporting a global PC decline in the fourth quarter. Last month Citi Research analyst Jim Suva initiated coverage of Dell shares with a Buy rating and $55 price target, noting that the current valuation discount of 40% to 50% to its peers is too wide given ""a much more favorable product offering.” Suva might be on to something. Fast forward a few weeks later, Dell shares have already surpassed Suva’s target. Will its numbers on Thursday call for a target upgrade? For the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the Round Rock, TX.-based company to earn $1.89 per share on revenue of $23.46 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.14 per share on revenue of $19.63 billion. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 38% year over year to $6.57 per share, while full-year revenue of $90.97 billion would rise 13.8% year over year. In the third quarter, the company delivered revenue of $22.5 billion. Though that marked an impressive 15% year-over-year increase, the company generated an operating loss of $356 million. On an adjusted basis, it generated an operating income of $2.1 billion, but it was down 2% from the year prior. In other words, the report was a mixed bag. On Thursday Wall Street will want Dell, which is projected to deliver a 7% jump Q4 revenues, show that it can also grow its bottom line. Its adjusted full-year earnings are expected to rise about 7.3%. This is important given the company’s debt load which has become a concern for investors. Much of this debt, estimated to be $50.3 billion, is from Dell’s $67 billion buyout of EMC. In the past two years, it has paid down almost $15 billion in gross debt, including roughly $1.3 billion in Q3. As such, profits will remain constrained for the foreseeable future and underscores the importance of the cash flow generation. Good news is, Dell, which is expected to benefit from its dominant position in the enterprise IT solutions market, ended Q3 with a cash and investments balance of $20.4 billion. Investors will be looking to see if this figure can rise in 2019 and how much of the company’s cash will go towards debt retirement.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 28, 2019, 08:14:58 AM EDT",Dell (DELL) Fourth Quarter Earnings: What to Expect
141,"Two newly released reports on the Canadian broadband sector offer insights into the transition to 5G and the disruptive forces in the sector over the near-term, including DTC, the global reach of services and the focus on optimizing the subscriber experience, according to Moody's. Alongside the analysis of the sectoral forces at work, Moody's analysts -- including senior vice president Bill Wolfe -- weighed in on their credit impacts to Canadian companies. Among the highlights: - Moody's said the ongoing internetization of communications and commerce will accelerate in 2019-20 as fifth-generation (5G) wireless protocols and improved satellite internet capabilities augment ongoing improvements in 'last-mile connectivity.' - It added 5G wireless and improved satellite internet capabilities both represent ""positive steps"" in last-mile connectivity, but network providers' financial returns from them are ""uncertain."" - According to Moody's, three main disruptive forces will continue in 2019-20: direct-to-consumer (DTC) communications, which disintermediate network-dependent services; access to by-product information, which redistributes advertising spending; and global reach, which amplifies economies of scale. - Moody's noted both mobile and fixed-line internet is steadily growing over time, and younger demographics display higher penetration and spending rates.",MT Newswires,"February 27, 2019, 03:53:38 PM EDT","Technology Sector Update for 02/27/2019: BCE.TO, T.TO, SJR-B.TO"

143,"By Jimmy Zhong, CEO of IOST, the application-friendly, next generation public blockchain infrastructure, helping decentralized app developers overcome some of the most challenging problems with mass adoption. Since its inception, advocates of blockchain technology have been working towards mainstream adoption. In the past year, many have weighed in on how and when this may occur, but most have agreed that enterprises and consumers face significant barriers when it comes to incorporating this technology into their operations and their daily lives. While many projects race to build the infrastructure that may one day serve as the basis for exponential mainstream adoption, the power of supporting real, functioning, decentralized apps, also known as DApps, for users to engage with is often overlooked. It is entirely possible that a breakthrough in mainstream adoption across industries such as banking and financial markets, gaming, and healthcare will not be awarded to the project with the best technology. Indeed, a breakthrough in mainstream adoption will depend heavily on the usability and popularity of the applications themselves. In its current state, access to the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is largely limited. Users can only own cryptocurrencies by mining or purchasing their cryptocurrency of choice on an exchange – activities that require a fair amount of technical and background knowledge, ranging from knowledge of computer science to complex KYC and trading processes. Unless the industry opens up a better dialogue with the users it is trying to target, adoption rates will stagnate. To prevent a standstill, the industry could take a leaf out of AOL’s book in the early internet era, when the company started distributing free CDs, packaged attractively with content, through door-to-door mailing. This made it easier and more appealing for everyday people who hadn’t used online services to trial AOL’s offering. In the same vein, the best approach to encouraging the adoption of blockchain technology may be to promote this level of inclusiveness and lower the barriers to entry, giving people easy access to participate in industry growth in meaningful ways. At this point in time, users need a Mail app to send and receive emails, not a smtp or POP3 protocol. The industry must build applications for users wherein the use of cryptocurrency makes sense and benefits them, something that IOST is focusing on. There are several applications that are making strides when it comes to giving users easy access to cryptocurrency. Existing DApps such as Bermi, a social network that rewards users for creating and engaging with short videos, ActiFit, which enables users to earn from their everyday movements and exercise, and Ethlend, a peer-to-peer lending platform, possess low barriers to entry and allow users to familiarize themselves with earning and spending cryptocurrencies to engage with the DApps’ purpose. This in turn gradually embeds the idea of smart contracts into the user experience, making users actually adopt the infrastructure of blockchain. While the uptake of DApps will span many industries and use cases, gaming is the current poster child for the adoption of smart contract technology. Tokenizing real-world assets such as art and real estate comes with the cost and inconvenience of auditing and custodial solutions, and since the majority of business logic in gaming is already coded online, blockchain adoption is made easy and human interaction is unnecessary. In this way, token rewards can be easily distributed to gamers in a more transparent manner. When it comes to other major industries, particularly banking and financial markets, healthcare, entertainment, and general enterprise, promising use cases are coming to the fore through DApp development, but adoption is proving far more challenging. Projects such as Rate3, an identity management platform, Aragon, a digital business register, and Brave, a fast and private browser, are certainly advancing their respective industry applications. However, to date, disruption through DApps has been difficult to get off the ground, as much of the capital has been raised by larger blockchain infrastructures. To take the industry to its next stage of growth, and toward mainstream acceptance and mass use, larger projects have a duty to work with funding partners to allocate resources to promising individual DApps. Incubators and accelerators like Bluehill can help to support developers of DApps and provide the tools needed to launch valuable applications for consumers and enterprises. Modelling after its success in launching DApp projects in network security, payment processing, and content distribution, other VCs and incubators should give more attention to helping DApp developers build real-world applications. Only then will we see more industries beyond gaming move to blockchain. As the blockchain industry remains optimistic about a future where this technology permeates almost every aspect of our lives, it is now critical for influential players to set their sights on demonstrating the tangible benefits and value that DApps can offer. If not, we risk blockchain pursued for the sake of blockchain.",Guest Contributors,"February 27, 2019, 02:37:27 PM EDT",DApps in Focus: Moving Beyond the Infrastructure and Toward Mass Use

147," Payments processing specialist Square (SQ) will report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. Just how much has the company’s payment ecosystem grown during the recent rise of the fintech industry? The company is coming off its sixth straight quarter of accelerated revenue growth. Understandably, expectations remain high as Q4 estimates calls for growth of 61% year over year. Another area analysts will focus on will be Square’s gross payment volume (GPV), which has surged more than 30% year over year in the previous two quarters. It’s for this reason shares of the payment processor have skyrocketed 35% year to date, including 10% over the past month. Notably, even with the strong stock surge, the shares rest some 25% off their 52-week high. The good news is that the company continues to add to its ecosystem of products and services. The company’s Cash App, which stands out among competitors like PayPal (PYPL) is one example. It goes without saying Square needs a strong earnings report Wednesday to keep this impressive rally going. For the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the San Francisco, Calif.-based company to earn 14 cents per share on revenue of $454.1 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 8 cents per share on revenue of $282.66 million. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 66% year over year to 46 cents per share, while full-year revenue of $1.58 billion would rise 60% year over year. In the third quarter, the company delivered revenue growth of 51% year over year, while adjusted — excluding the acquisitions of Zesty and Weebly — revenue rose almost 70%. Just as impressive was Square's profitability, where adjusted EBITDA increased 107% year over year to $71 million. On Wednesday, analysts will look to see whether these growth trends can continue in 2019, particularly in terms of EBITDA margin. Led by CEO Jack Dorsey, Square has made aggressive moves to grow beyond just a card reader platform to a service that provides businesses with a host of payroll tools, employee management, and analytics. These moves have paid off as the company now generates a sizable chunk of revenue from these service subscriptions as well as things like business loans from Square Capital, which aims to provide financing and bank loans to small businesses. The company on Wednesday must demonstrate the strength of Square Capital and guide in a way that suggests it can become the growth contributor it has been touted to be. Elsewhere, analysts will also focus on operating expense and the extent to which Square will begin to shift its focus towards boosting profitability and cash flow. To the extent these metrics can continue to improve, Square stock might have only begun to rise.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 27, 2019, 08:15:49 AM EDT",Square (SQ) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect
148,"Shares of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) have surged some 17% so far in 2019, besting the 11% rise of the S&P; 500 index. And for the company to maintain its outperformance, it must project confidence when it reports first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. This is because after two straight quarters of growth, PC shipments declined for both the fourth quarter and year in 2018, according to data released last Thursday from research firm Gartner. Owing to a shortage of CPUs (central processing units) which created supply chain issues, Global PC sales fell 4.3% to 68.6 million units in Q4, and 1.3% to 259.4 million in 2018, the firm noted. During the quarter HP, which lead in global PC sales for much of 2018, fell out of the top spot in, coming in second to China’s Lenovo’s (LNVGY). Despite the slump in PC shipments, Lenovo’s market share during the quarter grew to 24.2% from 21.9% and to 22.5% from 20.8% for the year, overtaking HP, Gartner noted. How much of this weakness will impact HP’s top and bottom lines? Those are some of the more pressing questions investors will hope the company will answer. Given the stock’s year-to-date performance, investors don’t appear too worried. But to keep the stock heading in the right direction, HP will need to show it can grow its profit margins, while issuing confident revenue guidance. For the quarter that ended January, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 52 cents per share on revenue of $14.88 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 48 cents per share on revenue of $14.52 billion. For the full year, ending in October, earnings are projected to increase 9% year over year to $2.20 per share, while full-year revenue of $59.63 billion would mark a 2% year-over-year rise. In the fourth quarter the company delivered revenue of $14.59 billion, which surpassed Street estimates by $320 million, while adjusted EPS of 52 cents came in a penny above the Street. As evident by the recent drop in the stock price it would seem investors haven’t forgotten the suffering they’ve been through when HP suffered multiple quarters of revenue declines dating back to 2010. In the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue results came in ahead of consensus, coming in at $15.4 billion, beating the $15.1 billion that analysts were calling for. Profits of $1.5 billion, or 54 cents per share on an adjusted basis, matched expectations and garnered an applause by investors, sending the stock surging in the after-hour session. That’s because the figure was also 10% better on a year over year basis. The company’s outlook for fiscal 2019, however, is what investors will focus on to determining the real value of HP shares. This is because the company’s revenue growth is expected to take a slight dip this fiscal year. There are also questions as to the extent the company’s improving PC and Printer businesses, which drove positive earnings in fiscal 2018, can continue to drive market share gains.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 27, 2019, 08:12:15 AM EDT",Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect

150,"Tech giants get the headlines, but there’s plenty of action and opportunity among the smaller firms as well. Wall Street’s top-rated analysts have taken note, including several from the Top 25 in the TipRanks database. TipRanks analyzes the analysts, rating over 5,000 experts from Wall Street’s best firms based on the accuracy and success of their stock ratings. Let’s see what they have to say about three buy-rated companies which have shown significant share-price gains in recent weeks. HubSpot, Inc. (HUBS – Research Report) HubSpot is both a smaller player and big name in the tech world. The company, which boasts a market cap of $6.7 billion, is known as an innovator in inbound marketing software, whose products ease the lives of social media marketers, content managers, and SEO optimization experts. HubSpot operates on the “freemium” model, offering a number of services without charge, with upgrades and premium services available through paid subscription. The model works for them. Earlier this month, HUBS reported EPS of 37 cents, beating the forecast 30 cents by 23%. Gross revenues were also up, at $144 million. This was 4.7% over the estimates, and well above the year-ago quarter’s $106.5 million. Canaccord analyst Richard Davis (Track Record & Ratings), rated #1 overall in the TipRanks database, saw the Q4 results as solid, noting the company’s “…customer additions, strong business trends, upside to free cash flow, and better than average fundamentals.” He raised his price target to $190, suggesting an 11% upside for HUBS shares. Writing for Rosenblatt Security, Marshall Senk (Track Record & Ratings), another five-star analyst, agrees with Davis’ view of this stock. In his comments, Senk says, “HubSpot delivered a very strong fourth quarter with the subscription line exceeding our estimate by $6 million with that out-performance driving better-than-expected bottom line results. “We are increasing our 2019 and 2020 estimates to reflect both the strong new product offerings and the improved go-to market plan.” Senk also raised his price target, to $182, implying a modest, though real, upside potential of 7%. HubSpot currently holds a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating from the analyst consensus, based on 10 buy and 4 hold reviews. The average price target is $187, which gives a 10% upside to the current share price of $170.  LivePerson, Inc. (LPSN – Research Report) This company, based in New York City, offers real-time messaging platforms for websites and social networks, on desktop and mobile devices. LivePerson’s products are a boon for customer service departments, and lead the way in conversational commerce. That said, LivePerson’s recently quarterly earnings did not light a fire under anyone. The company missed on EPS, posting 1 cent against an expected 2 cents, while revenues were high at $65.72 million. While EPS was low, the revenues represented a gain of $8.33 million over the previous Q4. Stock watchers took their cue from company CEO Rob LoCascio, who said, “We expect our revenue growth rate to ramp toward 20% by year-end in 2019 and to exceed it 20% in 2020 as we take a greater share of emerging multibillion-dollar market opportunity.” LPSN shares are up more than $2 since the Q4 report. Ryan MacDonald (Track Record & Ratings), from Needham & Company, wrote, “LivePerson continues to report strong metrics that support a continued reacceleration of growth.” He points out higher than expected forward guidance, and raised his price target to $30, indicating a 6.5% upside. Oppenheimer’s Koji Ikeda (Track Record & Ratings) also takes an upbeat view of LivePerson. In his comments on the stock, he noted several strong notes from the Q4 report: “Total revenue of $65.7M was ~$600K above consensus; and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3M was ~$200K above consensus. 1Q total revenue guidance of $65.75-66.75M is in line with the $66.1M consensus.” Ikeda’s price target, $33, suggests a 17% upside to LPSN. Overall, LivePerson gets a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating, based on 7 recent buy reviews. LPSN shares hold a 14% upside potential, based on an average price target of $32 and a share price of $27.  RingCentral, Inc. (RNG – Research Report) RingCentral combines telecommunications with the tech sector, offering a cloud-based business telephone system as its flagship product. Using cloud software lowers the cost for customers, while still providing tradition business telephone services: universal telephone numbers, fax, voice mail, and call forwarding. A strong product underlay an expectation-beating Q4 earnings report. The forecast called for 18 cents per share in earnings based on $181 million in sales; the reality was 23 cents EPS and $189 million in revenues. It was good news all around, with five-star analysts taking note and raising their price targets on RNG. First up was Terry Tillman (Track Record & Ratings) from SunTrust Robinson. Tillman noted “continued momentum with key growth and upside driver, that included a 60% increase in enterprise/mid-market business and stronger channel sales.” His price target, $120, gives a 13% upside to RNG. Next up was Brian Peterson (Track Record & Ratings), of Raymond James. Peterson set a $117 price target, suggesting an upside potential of 10%, and pointed out “RingCentral's earnings beat was highlighted by 34 percent growth in total revenue to $188.6 million. The company benefited from continued momentum across key growth channels like enterprise where annual recurring revenue rose 99 percent from last year.” Peterson also noted that RingCentral benefitted from a below-average churn rate. Finally, the #6-rated analyst in TipRanks’ database, Oppenheimer’s Brian Schwartz (Track Record & Ratings), also gave RNG a price target of $117. Schwartz noted that revenue and subscription guidance suggest a possible slowdown in the second half of 2019, but believes that is outweighed by the company’s strengths. Of those strengths, he said, “On the positive end, the quarter marks the highest upside in revenue growth and absolute dollars in 10 quarters. The company secured a record high total contract value deal of at least $10 million in the education sector. Customer retention reached a record high of more than 90 percent.” It’s a rosy picture for RNG, reflected in the ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. That consensus is based on 9 buy ratings and 2 holds. The current share price of $105 and the average price target of $112 give a comparatively modest upside potential of 6.5%, but these recent analyst reviews suggest that potential may be understated.

161,"By Landon Manning The government of South Australia, one of Australia’s six states, is going to conduct an upcoming election using blockchain technology. Local news sources confirmed that the Australian blockchain company Horizon State was “contracted by the South Australia Government to provide the technology and support for the blockchain-based election.” Horizon State’s CEO Nimo Namaani called the move “an exciting first government use of our tech in Australia, and a great way to validate the blockchain use for this purpose.” He claimed, “The South Australian government is very forward thinking and we are honoured they chose us to provide the technology.” Multiple nations worldwide have already begun experimenting with blockchain-based voting technology. Last November, for example, a major political party in Thailand used distributed ledger technology to conduct primary elections, selecting candidates that would go on to compete in a more conventional election. Similarly, South Korea has also begun to consider how this technology would be implemented in this way. What makes South Australia’s upcoming election noteworthy, however, is the scale on which it will be conducted. Namaani called it “a complex vote — being preferential with reserved seats, and a large cohort of candidates to choose from,” and the blockchain-based vote will be legally binding. Multiple candidates and sitting politicians have voiced their support for this move, with South Australia’s premier Steven Marshall planning to turn the state into the “blockchain capital of the country.” He publicly claimed, “Blockchain [technology] is going to be important into the future as we manage global supply chains,” so it would make sense to get the state’s populace well-acquainted to the technology.

163,"Revealed – the new Samsung Galaxy S10 will have a built-in crypto wallet! That’s the word spreading fast round the crypto-oriented interwebs over the last few days. There have been rumors of this development since January, when an image leaked of the new phone, showing a blockchain button on the home screen, but Samsung’s February 21 release announcement made it official – the latest Galaxy phone will be pre-enabled for secure storage of crypto keys. For those of you following the ebbs and flows of cryptocurrency, this may not seem the most important development. After all, per CoinWatch.com, the crypto market is down almost 10% in just the last 18 hours, after a solid week or more of gains. So, what can a smartphone company have to do with that? How can Samsung’s wallet app make a difference to the $130 billion cryptocurrency marketplace? Let’s break it all down for those of you are not blockchain geeks. The Patents before the Release January’s rumors did not come out in a vacuum. A month earlier, in December, news broke that Samsung had filed several patents in the European Union’s Intellectual Property Office. The patents locked in three proprietary trademarks, all related to blockchain: “Blockchain KeyStore,” “Blockchain key box,” and “Blockchain Core.” Now, there is nothing unusual about a company filing patents, or filing those patents months or years in advance of releasing the related product. The important point here is that Samsung has, legally, established ownership over these phrases for marketing purposes – and all three phrases relate to storing access data for blockchain applications. And then the images leaked of the blockchain button on the phone. The rumor mill went in to high gear. Securing the Wallet App Now the rumors are confirmed – the Galaxy S10 will have a built-in blockchain app. Which naturally brings us to questions about its use and security. Security first, as that is and always has been a key selling point of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies. According to the company, “Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services.” Knox is Samsung’s solution for mobile security, designed to provide a secure environment for smartphone devices. The company has been using Knox since 2013, and it has received both the US Department of Defense and US National Information Assurance Association security certifications. Knox maintains security by continuously verifying device integrity at the OS and hardware levels. In effect, it isolates the hardware chip on which the wallet app is installed. Samsung also uses the Exynos 9820 application processor, a proprietary device, to create a semiconductor-based cryptographic key for the Galaxy S10. With a cryptocurrency wallet installed on the phone, they are taking security seriously at both the app and device levels. Getting Blockchain to the Masses? The importance of Samsung’s move for cryptocurrencies, and for blockchain as a useful secure-transfer technology, cannot be understated. While the S10 is not the first smartphone with a crypto wallet – China’s Huawei, Taiwan’s HTC, and Sirin Labs all have devices on the market – it is the first by a major manufacturer worldwide reach and reputation. Samsung is the world’s largest smartphone maker. The company holds 18.7% of the market share, and shipped 292 million devices, globally, in 2018. What they do, others will follow, if for no other reason than the sheer necessity of not falling behind. And with an audience that size, the new blockchain wallet feature will reach millions of customers who might otherwise not be exposed to cryptocurrencies. Using Cryptos with the Wallet In early reviews, it appears that Samsung’s app will support both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as default settings. Together these two cryptos hold 63% of the market cap (Ripple’s XRP holds most of the rest), and it appears – although is not confirmed – that the app will include an ‘add more’ feature. Right from the start, this new blockchain wallet will offer S10 users access to two-thirds of the crypto market. In addition, Samsung’s term and conditions for the Blockchain KeyStore – the part of the app that will provide security for the crypto access key – includes a direct statement that inquiries are directed to Samsung’s Payment’s Services Group. This is being taken as a hint that Samsung may, in the near future, begin accepting direct cryptocurrency transfers as payment for services. By providing access to the crypto market, and hinting that it may soon start accepting crypto as payment, Samsung is indicting a tremendous level of support and confidence in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a transition point; in order to succeed, it needs to break out of its niche market and enter the mainstream. Acceptance by a company of Samsung’s size and reach makes that a distinct possibility. The Bottom Line The Galaxy S10 comes out 10 years after the first Galaxy S model, and, coincidentally, 10 years after Bitcoin heralded crypto’s arrival in the markets. The new phone will be a direct competitor with Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone X models in the top-end smartphone niche. In that competition, the new blockchain wallet may be an important feature in customer decisions. In any case, we’ll find more when the phone starts shipping on March 8.

164,"The hedge funds’ 13F filing season generates a blizzard of raw data, and the sheer volume is a tad overwhelming. Fortunately, the major financial players will throw that data to teams of analysts, who wade in undaunted, and re-release the figures in distilled form. The result: hedge fund trends become easily discernable. So, let’s thank Citi Research for comparing the 13Fs of the 50 largest hedge funds, and telling us where those funds were investing in the last quarter. The results are interesting; the four most popular stocks bought by those hedge funds were Facebook, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. It was a who’s who of big tech companies, the ones that have made headlines, sometimes for the wrong reasons, but usually for gigantism: huge companies, huge share prices, huge returns, and huge profits. Let’s look into TipRanks’ database, and see what the top Wall Street analysts are saying about these companies now. Facebook, Inc. (FB – Research Report) Facebook, more specifically, Mark Zuckerberg, has been hammered in the headlines for much of the last year and half. From testifying to Congress, to getting caught up in data privacy scandals, it just seems that Zuckerberg can’t win. Except that the result was that FB stock fell 22% in 2018- and became increasingly reasonable in terms of price. According to data from Citigroup, 15 of the 50 largest funds loaded up on Facebook stock – compared to only 6 in the previous quarter. So far, it seems to have been a good investment, as FB shares are up $30 since the start of the year. Consistently strong financial, typified by a good Q4 earnings report, have boosted Facebook. Analyst Ronald Josey (Track Record & Ratings), of JMP Securities, noted that “renewed confidence that usage, engagement, and monetization can continue to grow meaningfully as investments around Video, Stories, and Messaging, among others, begin to deliver ROI.” He acknowledges that data privacy and security issues remain a concern, but even so, he raised his price target to $195, indicating a 20% upside potential. Merrill Lynch’s Justin Post (Track Record & Ratings) agrees that data privacy may continue to haunt Facebook, and noted that a UK Parliamentary committee has recently released a report on the subject – a concern, since the UK levied a fine of 500,000 pounds on the company after the Cambridge Analytica fiasco last year. Post remains bullish, however, due to FB’s financial situation, confident that the company can weather regulations. His price target is $205, suggesting an upside of 26% to the stock. So it’s no wonder that Facebook retains a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. Shares are priced at $161, and the average price target of $189 gives a 17% upside. FB’s overall rating is based on an impressive 32 ‘buys,’ with 6 ‘holds’ and 2 ‘sells.’  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT – Research Report) Bill Gates’ baby Microsoft has been around since 1975, so pushing its mid-forties it’s considered old for a tech company. Call it ‘mature middle age.’ It brings certain advantages to a company. For starters, Microsoft has been a recognized and well-known brand for decades. Its Windows OS is ubiquitous, and by putting its Office software on the cloud, it made a good product more convenient for more users. And the company has long ago outgrown the sort of media headlines that have been plaguing Facebook. Citigroup’s data shows that 14 of the largest hedge funds are increasing their MSFT holdings. While this is down from last quarter’s 21, it still represents 28% of the largest funds – clearly, Microsoft offers a strong investment opportunity. Top analysts agree that Microsoft is worth buying. The #3 rated analyst in the TipRanks database, Ross MacMillan (Track Record & Ratings) from RBC Capital, give the stock a solid ‘buy’ rating with a $124 price target – implying an 11% upside. Morgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss (Track Record & Ratings) shares this confidence, shown by his $140 target on MSFT stock. He sees MSFT as a buying opportunity now, and says, “As the IT conversation shifts from pure Public Cloud towards Hybrid Cloud architectures, Microsoft will pull ahead as the best secularly positioned firm in tech. The company's secular positioning and durable growth give it the best risk/reward in software.” Weiss’s price target suggests a 26% upside to this stock. With shares trading at $110, and an average price target of $123, MSFT has an upside of 11%. The stock holds a ‘Strong Buy’ by the analyst consensus, based on 20 ‘buy’ ratings, 1 ‘hold,’ and 1 ‘sell.’  Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL – Research Report) Alphabet’s greatest strength is simultaneously its greatest public liability. Its Google search engine has access to the world’s greatest library of online data – everything from personal search habits to vital stats – and it uses that information to create the perfect platform for targeted online advertising. It’s a product with an unlimited customer base: literally every company with an online presence. That ubiquitous product and near-infinite product reach may explain why 26% of the largest hedge funds – 13 altogether, by Citi’s data – are investing more in GOOGL. The company’s analyst reviews provide additional clarity. Start with Mark Mahaney (Track Record & Ratings), of RBC Capital. Mahaney points out “significant secular growth for internet advertising, very strong market share in core search business, and significant competitive moats.” His price target, $1,300, suggests a 16% upside to GOOGL. Meanwhile SunTrust’s Youssef Squali (Track Record & Ratings) gives greater detail coming to a similar conclusion. He says, “The company's core business of Search and especially YouTube are performing at impressive growth levels, with added support coming from the scaling segments like Cloud, Play, and hardware and emerging ones like Waymo. Expect Alphabet to sustain its mid-teen growth over the next several years with a focus on incremental profit and free cash flows, making the stock an attractive growth story at a compelling valuation.” Squali gives GOOGL shares a 21% upside, with a $1,350 price target. Alphabet’s analyst consensus is another ‘Strong Buy,’ based on 28 ‘buy’ ratings and only 1 ‘hold.’ The stock’s $1,346 average price target and $1,116 current share price suggest a 20% upside potential. Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet are huge companies, attracting a great deal of media coverage – some by their own intent, and some by force of circumstance. There’s a tendency among investors and analysts, sometimes, to shun the market’s giants, on the theory that you can find better deals with less baggage elsewhere. The big hedge funds don’t seem to agree in this case, and as our closer look at these three suggests, these whales may actually be right.

165,"Microsoft    unveiled the second generation of its      Hololens augmented reality    headset at a press event in Barcelona Sunday. The new headset   features more than double the field of view of the original   Hololens, according to   Microsoft    technical fellow Alex Kipman, while still offering 47 pixels per   degree of sight.   Say hello to       #HoloLens2        .              pic.twitter.com/eVBQ9OUeM1  - Microsoft       HoloLens        (@HoloLens)       February 24, 2019 makeArticleAd();     Doubling the field of view is a big step for Hololens.   Microsoft has never published the field-of-view data of the   original Hololens, but has been reported to be between 30 and 35   degrees horizontally. The company didn't share exact   field-of-view data about the new headset either Sunday. One of the major new features of Hololens 2 is hand tracking,   which allows users to touch and interact with holograms. In a   demo shown on stage Sunday, Hololens 2 was capable of precisely   tracking each and every finger, allowing users to touch buttons   and even play an AR piano. The headset also comes with integrated eye tracking, and is   meant to be more ergonomic. This includes a display that flips   up, allowing wearers to easily switch between AR and real-world   without having to take off the headset. Microsoft also developed   what Kipman called a ""universal fit system"" for the device - a   subtle dig at the Magic Leap One, which has to be custom-fitted   for each and every user. Microsoft is clearly still positioning the Hololens as a   device for professionals. Kipman was launched on stage by Anand   Argawala, the CEO of Spatial, for a demo of   AR-powered meetings    . Kipman also said that the company has made it easier for   enterprise partners to customize the Hololens hardware to their   own needs. That focus on the enterprise also had a clear impact on the   device pricing: Hololens 2 will cost $3500. The device can be   pre-ordered effective immediately, and will initially be sold in   United States, Japan, China, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom,   Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand. However, Microsoft also made it clear that it wants to be part   of entertainment - if only the production side, for now. Kipman   was joined on stage by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, who announced   his company was adding Hololens 2 support to the Unreal Engine in   an attempt to bring AR production tools to Hollywood and the   video games industry. Sweeney also hinted at a possibility that some of that   technology will reach consumers at some point, saying: ""In the   years to come, Epic will support Hololens in all of our   endeavors."" In addition to Hololens 2, Microsoft also announced a few   other hardware and software products that will enable   next-generation immersive experiences. These include what the   company calls   Spatial Anchors     - essentially a cloud-based AR solution that makes it   possible to share persistent AR experiences across devices,   including Android and iOS phones as well as Hololens headsets. ""   This will enable the internet of holograms,"" said Kipman. The company also announced remote rendering for AR   experiences, and unveiled a new hardware accessory for the use of   AR and other sensor-rich experiences in enterprises with the   Azure Kinect depth-sensing camera. The Azure Kinect developer kit   will be available for $399.

We're going to miss your voice in our board       conversations.               https://t.co/27pxrieh9S  - jack (@jack)       February 22, 2019 I appreciate you, Ev!

Williams has   been divesting much of his Twitter ownership recently, selling   off around 8 million shares over the last three months alone,   according to SEC filings. Williams owned 29 million Twitter shares in April of 2018. By   February of 2019, that number was down to around 11 million. This   means that he now owns just around 1.5% of the company, based on   outstanding shares, as opposed to 3.86% he held back in April of   2018. Williams' term on Twitter's board was set to expire in   2021.

171,"When Zillow (Z) announced their earnings yesterday, they challenged one well-worn cliché in pursuit of another. It is often said that you cannot go back, but with the current CEO Spencer Rascoff stepping down to make way for former boss Rich Barton, it seems that Zillow is doing just that. Barton, a co-founder of the company along with Lloyd Frink, a partnership that also “founded” Expedia (EXPE) when it was spun off from Microsoft (MSFT), will take over again at a time of big changes for the company. Zillow is known as a property search site but has recently made moves into buying and selling homes as well as mortgage generation. The stock responded positively to the news, it is up over six percent in early trading this morning from yesterday’s close, but is the change significant for investors? The short answer is yes. When companies are undergoing drastic changes, a recognizable, trusted figure at the helm is an important asset. For evidence, I give you Apple (AAPL). Of course, it is possible that Apple would have gone on to the massive success it achieved without the reappointment of Steve Jobs as CEO, but it is hard to imagine it without him. As you can see from the chart below, trust matters to Zillow right now. The news that it had purchased Mortgage Lenders of America last summer was, shall we say, not well received by the market:  That news is not the only reason the stock dropped nearly sixty percent from its high in the second half of last year, but it was the most important one. A generally softer housing market and a drop off in its main revenue source, advertising by real estate agents, also contributed but investors were obviously worried that by moving into flipping properties and providing mortgages, Zillow had bitten off more than it could chew. However, there is another cliché that applies here: in business, if you aren’t going forward, you are going backwards. Barton, with his experience at Expedia, knows that better than most. Tech disruptors can quickly achieve a dominant position in a market, but they are always vulnerable to competition, and for a company whose success is built on rapid growth, standing still is simply not an option. Moving into buying and selling properties and mortgage generation is risky given the cyclical nature of the real estate market, but it plays into a well-known trait of consumers: they're lazy. We like one-stop shopping even, or maybe especially, when it comes to major purchases. There is a reason most car financing is done at dealerships, even though the cut they take from financing deals makes it likely that buyers could get a better deal elsewhere. It's all about convenience. We all like to think that we are rational economic actors who search diligently for the best deal on everything but, in reality, we will often sacrifice economic efficiency for an easy transaction. Searching for a home on Zillow, then buying from them with a mortgage arranged by them may not be the best available deal from an economic perspective, but the company is betting that it will appeal to enough buyers to make it work. I wouldn’t bet against them. The earnings report showed a slight beat on both the top and bottom lines, but not enough to justify the big jump in the stock. That looks to be a reaction to the return of Barton at a critical time for Zillow, and that suggests that investors will give him time to enact the changes. Major changes to a business model usually result in turbulence in a stock but now, with that seemingly behind us, taking a chance on Zillow’s success looks like a decent long-term bet.",Martin Tillier,"February 22, 2019, 10:17:54 AM EDT",Zillow (Z): A Tale of Two Cliches

The streaming device   maker told investors Thursday that it projects to generate   between $1 billion and $1.025 billion this year, and that   international growth was one of its key investment areas for   2019.  Roku    made these announcements as part of its   Q4 earnings release    , which showed that it exceeded the market's expectations for the   holiday quarter.

This translates to earnings of $0.06 per   share. Analysts had expected revenue of $262.11 million, and $0.03   earnings per share. Investors sent Roku's share price up around   4% in after-hours trading, following a 4% decline earlier during   the day.makeArticleAd(); ""2018 was an excellent year for Roku, with record results and   solid progress towards our long-term vision of powering every TV   in the world,"" said CEO Anthony Wood in the company's letter to   investors.

""We estimate that   nearly 1 in 5 U.S. TV households now use the Roku platform to   stream at least a portion of their TV viewing,"" Wood said in the   investor letter. A closer look at Roku's numbers showed that the company grew   both its hardware as well as its ads and services business in Q4.   On the hardware side, Roku brought in $124.3 million in revenue,   compared to $102.8 million a year ago. 21% growth for this segment will please investors, who in the   past have been concerned with slowing hardware revenues as usage   shifts from dedicate streaming devices to smart TVs. The   company's hardware gross profit fell by 77%, suggesting a move   towards cheaper hardware as the company emphasizes account   growth. Even more important for the company's bottom line is what Roku   calls its platform revenue - advertising and licensing fees, with   ads making up the majority of that revenue stream. Platform   revenue grew 77% year-over-year, totaling $151.4 million in Q4.   Roku managed to more than double its monetized ad impressions in   2018, the company said Thursday.

However, executives cautioned that these investments wouldn't   pay off over night. Instead, they expect the company to start   accelerating account growth abroad in 2020, with international   revenue following after that. ""You need to build up scale before   you can ramp up monetization,"" said chief financial officer Steve   Louden in an interview with   Variety    Thursday afternoon. Roku currently sells its own streaming devices in 20   countries, including North America, France, the U.K. and a number   of Latin American countries. Louden also shared some perspective on Roku's audio efforts,   which began in earnest with the launch of the Roku Wireless   Speakers last fall. He said that the company purposefully decided   to not sell the speakers, which only work with TVs running Roku's   operating system, in retail stores.

175,"The Institute for Innovation Development has documented our stance that the greatest challenge for advisors today is dealing with a rapidly accelerating rate of business change – an operating environment that we haven’t been previously trained in or been equipped to handle. Technologies driven by FinTech companies are quickly rising to the challenge and providing much needed support, especially in the area of becoming a digital firm. There are explosive gains available right now in operational efficiency, productivity and enhanced profits by shifting traditional practices and legacy systems towards a digital infrastructure. Digitizing enables you to streamline client on-boarding; administrative and compliance workflows; and automates the way front-to-back offices operate, communicate and generate new business. The process of digitizing everything allows for the fluid, efficient control of your company’s data and client information and the increased ability to analyze and glean more insights about your business and your clients. Being a digital firm is the only way to have the business management and innovation agility to learn quickly, experiment with your customers, and pivot your business models to move on new opportunities and truly compete in our new operating environment of accelerating change.  It will equip you with the new level of business flexibility that is mandatory for survival, let alone competitive advantage. To better understand and explore this important issue and how to best engage with digital FinTech solutions, we decided to talk to Institute member Michael Pinsker, Founder & Chairman of Docupace Technologies  – a financial technology company that has created a cloud-based digital operations platform with data driven client onboarding, unified workflow and document management automation capabilities. Our goal is to better understand how to implement a digital transformation for your firm. Hortz:We keep hearing about the crucial need for financial firms to go through a process of digital transformation. What is truly meant by that and why is it so scary sounding? Pinsker: When we talk about digital transformation, we are speaking generally about any business process that uses digital technology instead of paper.  Opportunities for digital optimization exist across all offices and departments within a firm - anywhere from client onboarding to recruiting to basic document handling that is part of any operation of a wealth management firm.  When one looks at the issue of digital transformation, there are many factors that go into figuring out what is right for a given organization. The scary part of it is just that – transformation.  That is because transformation means change and change is difficult; especially when you go from existing paper driven processes to a new way of doing business.  It means policies and procedures will change, the technology will be new, people will have to adapt to different ways of handling tasks. But what I can tell you from extensive experience is that people can manage and embrace change when they are fully aware of and see the scale of benefits for doing so. Educating everyone in advance of the explosive gains in efficiency and competitiveness for the firm can drive wide-scale adoption for that change. Bottom-line reality is, when people realize it is essential, they understand the benefits to themselves and the company, change is very doable and less scary. Hortz:What do you recommend is the most important mindset or approach needed to start this transformation process? Pinsker:  At Docupace, we always advise our clients to start with the questions about the goals of what you are trying to accomplish.  There is a lot that can be done and the transformation process is a journey.  It takes time, but if you have your organizational goals outlined and keep them front and center, it will allow you to ask the right questions, to focus on the right things and achieve the best outcome possible. Hortz:What are the biggest concerns you have seen at this early stage that derail the beginning of the process and how have you best addressed them? Pinsker: We have seen a misalignment within organizations between the stakeholders and people on the ground that caused the process to go south right out of the gate.  To avoid any misunderstandings, our proven methodology calls for the creation of alignment between all stakeholders, client project teams, and Docupace’s professional services team at the start of the process. The other concern is taking on too much initially instead of managing the transformation process in bite chunks in order to build some immediate initial successes and continue to expand on it gradually.  The transformation is a complex multi-phased process and can quickly get out of hands if not managed right from the beginning.  We typically recommend defining the easy win early on and then building on top of it. Hortz:What options do firms have in the implementing stage that may ease some concerns and lead to greater success in the process? Pinsker: There are number of options that firms have to increase the chances of success.  We recommend starting with defining dedicated teams to manage transformation.  The transformation process benefits from having alignment and a focused team greatly increases chances for success. Other options include developing a tighter plan and detailed communication procedures with your technology vendor that is the cornerstone to the transformation.  Establishing a close partnership with the vendor, who is very experienced in driving transformation for similar organizations, is paramount.  It will also help create commitment and remove some of the concerns. Lastly, putting emphases on training and teams support during the transformation process, even after they go live, will have a great impact on the success of the project. Hortz:What then are the specific first steps you suggest firms go through to start the journey? Pinsker: We have put together a detailed  Docupace guide called How to Develop a Paperless Office Strategy which walks wealth management firms step by step through our recommended digital transformation process. The initial steps I would recommend are: Hortz: What other best practices have you seen that drive firms to successful implementation? Pinsker: The best successes we have seen are from the firms that take the transformation seriously and not underestimate the effort and the impact of it.  That is manifested and driven by proactive and consistent communication with stake holders, team members and everyone who is affected by the transformation. I cannot emphasize enough that we see a commitment to training and support - that is focused on adoption of the new way of doing business –as super critical for the long term success of the transformation. Hortz: Any last best advice would you like to share especially to advisors and small-to-midsize financial services firms? Pinsker: While digital transformation is not easy, once you undergo the process, the efficiencies and effectiveness of the organization increases tenfold.  Embrace the change, be thoughtful about what is important in your daily operation and be ready to compromise in order to launch it.  The initial set of processes will be different and may not be perfect, but through the process and continual improvement the result will be amazing.

178,"Orbit International Corp. (  ORBT  ) is on the cusp of a huge cash flow generation period that, by my estimation, will result in more than half the current market cap in cash. After winning a huge government contract, the company is going to see 2+ years of outsized growth with a record-high backlog of orders. Recent commentary by management suggests this will continue: ""follow-on orders expected on a majority of our major military programs along with several additional opportunities that could result in significant awards""  . The company is set to report 4Q:18 earnings early March, and I believe they will report a record quarterly profit of $0.24, the highest in recent history, show significant cash on the balance sheet, and start distributing this cash in additional dividends and further buybacks. Trading at only 7x my projected 2019 estimates, ORBT stock is a bargain at this price with a terrific margin safety i.e. a cash-rich balance sheet with no debt and a strong order book. ORBT designs and manufactures customized electronic components and power units for military, government, and commercial customers. The company has two divisions; Orbit Electronics Group (OEG) which manufactures and sells keyboards, displays, tablets etc. for the military (drones, helicopters etc.) and commercial companies (Airlines, Air Traffic Control). Customers here include Raytheon ( RTN  ), Boeing ( BA  ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT  ), Northrop Grumman ( NOC  ), and more. The second division is Orbit Power Group (OPG) which manufactures and sells power supplies, frequency converters etc. for military, oil and gas, utilities and rail. Customers include BAE Systems ( BAESF  ), L3 (LLL), Viasat (VSAT), and more. Orbit International was founded in 1957 and has been operating and building government, military, and commercial relationships ever since. The company has a wide range of ""ruggedized"" products, and in many cases, they are the sole source supplier on a number of contracts. Given the company's focus on government and military, there are high barriers to entry in terms of being a qualified supplier. As an example, if both Raytheon and Lockheed were bidding on a contract, no matter who wins, both companies use ORBT as a sub-contractor for certain parts. This puts the company in a solid position to win business and partner with some of the best companies in the world. I have followed ORBT for more than a decade; I have been a shareholder on and off a few times. First in 2005, again in 2009, and now, once again, in 2017 after a major contract win, which I detail further below. My average price is around $5.30. Following ORBT as an investment is more straightforward than most companies because they report a ""backlog"" of orders, i.e. business that has been won, and they now are in the process of fulfilling and booking revenue. Tracking the backlog of small companies is one of my favorite things to do. It allows you to time your entry and exit much better than many other companies. Backlog also gives you a margin of safety, reducing the element of surprise and giving you a better chance of predicting and modeling out future earnings and cash flow. This brings us to a little background, so that we have some context as to where we stand today relative to the past.  In 2003, ORBT earned $0.55 per share on $17mln in revenue, while the stock was around $6.80, the Enterprise Value was roughly $27mln, and the company had net cash of only $0.18 per share. At that point, the backlog was $10mln. By the 3rd Quarter of 2004, the backlog had increased to almost $13mln and by year-end, the company had earnings of $0.62 on $18mln in revenue, and a closing price of around $7.30 (an Enterprise Value of $30mln). Then, throughout 2005, the company won multiple awards, and by June, the backlog had risen to $14.5mln, and for the first 9 months, ORBT's earnings were $0.51 putting them on track for a record year. At that time, the stock peaked at almost $14 per share, valuing the company at around $65mln. In 2006, the backlog started to decline and so did earnings. The stock fell all the way back into the $4s but then recovered as the backlog increased to $16.9mln in mid-2007. The stock was rangebound between $7 and $9 with a steady Enterprise Value of $30mln to $40mln. During the financial crisis of 2008, the stock fell below $2 and like most companies, business dried up, margins started to fall, and ORBT suffered net losses (-$0.37 and -$0.03 in 2009 and 2010, respectively). However, by mid-2010, the company's backlog hit a record $21.2mln, and the company earned $0.67/share in 2011, causing the stock to rally from the sub $2 level to the mid $5s. By this time, the company had almost $4mln in debt, and at that $5.35 peak stock price, the Enterprise Value was around $28mln. The purpose of the above history study is to help put into context where the company stands today. ORBT started 2018 with a record 26.6mln backlog, on pace to report a record $0.72 per share in earnings with an enterprise value of only $15mln! The reason we are now getting all of this for such a low Enterprise Value is due to shrewd work by a great management team. Mitchell Binder took over as CEO in late 2010 and began a major cost-cutting plan and rightsizing of the business to maximize shareholder value. I have spoken to Mitch frequently over the past decade, and he is the quintessential ""stock price"" CEO, and by that, I mean he is focused on doing the right things to increase shareholder value. From late 2010 to now, Mitch has closed offices/facilities, cut expenses, de-listed the stock and reduced the share count by more than $1mln shares (almost a quarter of the market cap). During the years of 2009 to 2011, SG&A was running around $10mln when Binder took over. That number has steadily declined to around the current $6.5mln and has remained stable in that range ever since. In most of the earnings press releases, management has gone out of its way to reference the stable cost structure and to reiterate that these costs will not go up. In the most recen t report  ed quarter (3Q:18), management noted… "" Selling, general and administrative costs decreased     during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to our     tight management of costs"" Even with earnings on pace for a record year and with a huge backlog of orders, management was able to reduce SG&A in this most recent third quarter (3Q:18). The company's new cost structure was not Binder's only pursuit, as he also delisted the company's stock from the NASDAQ, saving roughly $350k a year (which adds almost $0.10 to annual earnings) and paid down all debt using the now solid cash flow generation, new business/EPS rebound and a lower cost structure. He did not stop there. He also had the fortitude to start buying back stock. I am not a big fan of stock buybacks unless your stock is clearly undervalued, or if you know business is about to get much better. In ORBT's case, it was both. The company started buying back stock in the low $3s, and as noted above, they have reduced the share count by almost one quarter. On September 19th, 2017, ORBT won a contract from the government for $21.7mln  to deliver 180 Common Aircraft Armament Test Sets (CAATS). To put that into perspective, that's a whole year's worth of revenue booked on one day! It's the largest contract they have ever won, and the initial orders against that contract sent the backlog to a record $26.6mln. In the press release announcing this contract, management noted that the gross margin will be lower but that "" no additional engineering, selling and administrative personnel will be needed; therefore, this contract should have a positive impact on incremental profitability during the delivery period."" This gets us to our earnings model for the duration of this contract:  Source: Model by author, using company reported data, and   author's estimates As per my model, above, you can see the new contract flowing through the numbers. I model it at roughly $2.2mln a quarter (very top column). I have estimated the normal revenue run rate of recurring business and other new orders running at around $5mln a quarter and add the CAATS contract onto that. I use a new lower gross margin as per management's guidance in the announcement press release. I take the recent historic 38-40% and blend it to low 20% for the CAATS orders to arrive at 32%. This gross margin could be a bit high or a bit low, but we will find out when they report their first full CAATS sellthrough quarter, which is this upcoming 4th quarter of 2018 (reported in about two weeks). The current $22.5mln backlog only includes about three quarters of the original order since only about $15mln was awarded so far. I expect to see another $4-6mln order announced within the next few weeks and combined with the almost $5mln in orders reported monthly in 4Q, my guess is that ORBT ends up with a record backlog again going into the back half of 2019. In the most recent press release, management said: "" Our consolidated outlook for 2019 remains positive with     follow-on orders expected on a majority of our major military     programs along with several additional opportunities that could     result in significant awards…"" If this is true and they do end up getting more ""significant awards"", this backlog will stay elevated through 2021. But, for now, purely with what we have right now, I model the company generating $2.8mln and $2.7mln in net income for 2019 and 2020. The company has NOLs that prevent them from paying taxes for at least the next four or five years. In the 2016 annual report, the company noted they had more than $10mln in NOLs. Here is the exact excerpt: ""The Company also has federal and New York state net     operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10,000,000 and     $700,000, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The net operating     loss carryforwards expire from 2018 through 2034"" I would estimate that NOL carryforward is now closer to $9mln. However, that is still a large number relative. I estimate the company ended 2018 with about $4mln ($1.12 per share) in cash and because they currently pay nominal taxes and have minimal CAPEX requirements, that elevated income goes straight to cash. For the first 9 months of 2018, CAPEX was only $180K and only $29k and $47K in 2017 and 2016, respectively. I estimated that cash balance will grow to almost $10mln by the end of 2020 due to cash generated from this large backlog and an additional but separate $573k tax refund they are expecting from the government due to the new tax laws recently past. At this point, ORBT will have cash of almost $3 per share, more than half the current stock price. If the backlog continues to be elevated or even normalizes and they earn $0.50 a year following the CAATS contract, cash should continue to accumulate, and in three or four years from now, the entire market cap could be cash! ORBT still has a buyback plan in place. As their tangible book value grows, I believe they will continue to buy back stock, but I think the focus has now shifted to dividends. The company started paying a $0.01 quarterly dividend ($0.04 annually), but in the press release, the company also said: ""Furthermore, the Company announced its intention to pay     quarterly and annual cash dividends to holders of its common     stock."" I believe there is a good chance that ORBT will also pay an annual special dividend to shareholders in the next few weeks, and as I said before, they are very shareholder-friendly and focused on enhancing shareholder value. The CEO used the words: ""our Board of Directors has determined that a cash dividend     also be utilized as part of our capital allocation strategy to     enhance shareholder value"". By buying shares of ORBT here, investors are essentially buying into a business on the verge of a multiyear cash flow generation surge. When you pull up ORBT's customers like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, you see them winning large government contracts on a global scale almost daily. ORBT is a key partner to these companies, so you have to believe that their future is at least decent if not bright. This is especially relevant if you think about the precarious situation the world is in right now from Russia to North Korea to the Middle East, to name a few. The current administration's focus on military spending seems to be positive, and I see no reason why this shouldn't continue for the foreseeable future. Technology has improved leaps and bounds these past few years, and I would imagine there are tons of upgrades that need to be made to military and government agencies around the world. If you look back at the early 2000s, ORBT was earning less than what we expect today with far less cash and much higher expense structure. The company had an Enterprise Value at one point of $65mln, and then again in 2011, when business wasn't nearly as good as now, they had an Enterprise Value of $28mln. When these new numbers flow through the P&L in 2019 and 2020 and when people see the sort of cash ORBT is on pace to generate relative to the current EV of only $15mln (and will be close to only $10mln in a year or two), you have to believe the stock will go up. If they do end up with cash of $10mln by the end of 2020 and they do, in fact, earn my projected $0.77 that will equate to an EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.4x, while ORBT's customers and partners mentioned above are trading at 9x. It seems reasonable to expect the stock to increase in value as earnings improve in 2019 and 2020, especially relative to the current EV of only ~$15m. And if it doesn't, I plan on sitting back and collecting dividends, quarterly and annually! Because the company is essentially ""dark"", info can be found on Bloomberg and on the company's website  and then also on OTC Markets.com  with the best and most relevant info under ""Filings and Disclosures"". It's important to note, however, that despite being on the Pinksheets, the company issues regular press releases on time earnings reports and filings, and management is very accessible. Investors should realize that the tax shield provided by the NOLs won't be permanent … it's unclear exactly where the NOLs stand, but with close to $9mln in NOLs, I do not expect the company to be taxed within the next four to five years, and after that, a 20%-25% tax rate should not impact the company too severely, especially compared to the old pre-tax cut 38% rate. The biggest risk is that government spending on the military dries up, and after a few good years we have had, this spending slows down, and ORBT's backlog declines, and the company's earnings fall. That's very possible, but it's hard to prognosticate what will happen, given the current state of the world. I can easily see spending staying where it is, especially given a need for just a basic general ""tech upgrade"" like LCD smart panels, keyboards, drones etc. Another question or risk to consider is the possibility that large defense contractors like RTN and LMT develop some of ORBT's products in house. I believe this is unlikely, given that the business ORBT focused on would be a drop in the bucket relative to the size of those companies. Furthermore, ORBT has built a niche as an add on partner, and there is likely not enough value add for these companies to play in this small niche area. For the next 18-24 months and probably long after that, shareholders of ORBT can get excited about and look forward to quarterly earnings press releases that we believe are going to show hugely positive numbers. Investors can also look forward to collecting a small quarterly dividend but also get excited about larger annual dividends.

180,"Shutterstock photo The driverless vehicle race is being run on computing power instead of horse power. This shift has created opportunities for companies other than OEM (original equipment manufacturers) to be a part of the increasingly software-driven automotive world. Intel (INTC) is one name which is on its way to become a dominant force in this space. Here’s a look at some developments made by Intel in 2018. Intel announced its restructuring in 2016 from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. Intel’s foray into the autonomous driving segment soon followed. BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye joined hands to create a safe and advanced platform fully automated driving. A few months later, Intel announced an investment of $250 million for autonomous driving which was followed by setting up of a new business unit called the Automated Driving Group (ADG), dedicated to the next generation of advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving solutions. The acquisition of Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion was Intel's big step in its self-driving journey. In January 2018, Mobileye and NavInfo collaborated to build and distribute Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) product in China.  Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) program enables the creation of precision maps at scale and low cost by leveraging the proliferation of camera-based safety systems on cars. An innovative, low cost and efficient solution to enable autonomous vehicles to localize themselves (precision localization) is a critical sensory input for the safe and affordable adoption of autonomous vehicles, right from Level 2+ (partial automation) systems to Level 5 (full automation). In addition to NavInfo, China’s SAIC entered a new collaboration with Mobileye develop Level3/Level4/Level5 autonomous vehicles as well as bring REM mapping to China. China has ambitious plans for self-driving technology. China expects smart cars with partially or fully autonomous functions to account for 50% of new vehicles sold in the country by 2020. In mid-2018, Baidu and Mobileye decided to work together towards safer autonomous vehicles. While great progress has been made by Baidu with more than a hundred global partners for Apollo, a number of challenges remain. To deliver safer self-driving technology, Baidu and Intel are collaborating to integrate and commercially deploy Mobileye’s Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) model in both the open source Project Apollo and commercial Apollo Pilot programs. “RSS formalizes human notions of safe driving into a verifiable model with logically provable rules, defines appropriate responses, and ensures that only safe decisions are made by the automated vehicle.” Intel is collaborating with companies such as Volkswagen and Champion Motors to push mobility-as-a-service (MaaS). Volkswagen Group, Intel’s Mobileye and Champion Motors partnered to commercialize mobility as-a-service with autonomous vehicles in Israel. The three companies will work on different aspects of the project which is being dubbed as “New Mobility in Israel” has been accepted by the government which be furnishing legal and regulatory support, sharing the required infrastructure and traffic data, and providing access to infrastructure as needed. The deployment will begin in 2019 and it will be rolled out in phases reaching full commercialization in 2022. A report by Strategy Analytics estimates that autonomous driving technology will enable a new passenger economy worth $7 trillion in 2050, out of which consumer use of a range of mobility-as-a-service offerings will account for $3.7 trillion, more than 50% of all revenues. Driverless cars present a number of social and economic benefits along with the promise of safety, efficiency and convenience as well as mobility. NHSTA says, “The continuing evolution of automotive technology aims to deliver even greater safety benefits and—one day—deliver Automated Driving Systems (ADS) that can handle the whole task of driving when we don’t want to or can’t do it ourselves.” It is estimated that 94% of serious crashes are due to human error. This means that driver assistance technologies in today’s motor vehicles are already helping to save lives and prevent injuries. The technology won’t just help reduce accidents and injuries but even the economic and social costs due to such incidents. These vehicles would enable smoother flow of traffic thereby reducing congestion and fuel consumption. The technology will be a boon for people with limited options of mobility. The advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) market is projected to reach $91.83 billion by 2025, from $24.24 billion in 2018 at a CAGR of 20.96%. While the global autonomous driving market is expected to grow up to $173.15 billion by 2030. Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. Overall, the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles presents a great opportunity for technology provider which are becoming an integral part of the automotive ecosystem.

181,"Is this another case of “seek and ye shall find” or have U.S. foes actually been increasingly resorting to cyberwars when they feel threatened by the world’s only superpower? For years, Russia has been seen as the leader of politically-instigated cyberwars against the U.S., frequently using them as tools to gain leverage and force the country to the negotiating table. Well, it’s probably not a coincidence that China and Iran, two nations whose relations with the U.S. have recently taken a turn for the worse, having escalated cyberattacks against the country with China even overtaking Russia as the biggest source of state-sponsored cyberattacks. There has been a surge of attacks on businesses and government agencies in the United States from Chinese and Iranian hackers, with experts fearing that America’s trade conflict with China and Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last year could be at the epicenter of the unfolding drama. State-sponsored attacks And, evidence suggests that these are not the work of isolated felons but rather are state-sponsored hacks that the two governments could be using for political expediency. Earlier this month, the Justice Department unsealed indictments against seven Iranians for conducting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against US banks. This is not the first time that Iranian citizens have been indicted for cyberattacks on US businesses, with an eerily similar case having happened nearly three years ago. Iran faced its first sanctions by the US four decades ago after a group of radicals seized the American embassy in Tehran and has faced several more down the line. But according to the New York Times, recent attacks have been more extensive than previously reported though actual details have not been divulged. The attacks have been attributed to the country by the National Security Agency (NSA) and FireEye Inc. (FEYE), a publicly-traded security firm, during last month’s government shutdown. According to intelligence officials, the Iranian attacks coincided with renewed Chinese offensive aimed at stealing trade and military secrets from American tech and military contractors. In December, two Chinese hackers were indicted by the DoJ for a decade-long global state-sponsored hacking campaign that saw trade secrets stolen from at least 45 US tech companies including icons such as IBM, Hewlett Packard and NASA. Even Chinese smartphone giant , HuaweiTechnologies Co., has not been spared with the country pressing charges against, and demanding the extradition of, the company’s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, for stealing trade secrets from mobile operator T-Mobile USA Inc. Same old… Now we’re moving backwards. China’s prolific attacks on the U.S. have resumed after a brief hiatus--all thanks to the ongoing trade hostilities between the two nations. After many years of economically-motivated cyberattacks on U.S. businesses, presidents Obama and Xi Jinping managed to reach a landmark agreement in 2015 that was meant to put a stop on Chinese industrial-espionage: ""We've agreed that neither the US or the Chinese government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage,"" Obama enthused. It came as a pleasant surprise that China did stick to its end of the deal. According to a 2016 report by FireEye, the number of attacks originating from China fell 83 percent after the deal, another strong confirmation that a large chunk of attacks coming from the country are state-sponsored. Unfortunately, the ceasefire was only to be short-lived. Quite tellingly, the latest wave of attacks by Beijing are closely aligned to the country’s ambitious “Made in China 2025” initiative that aims to make Beijing shift from the world’s factory floor to higher value products and services. It’s going to be interesting to see how the two nations will address the highly contentious problem of intellectual property theft in the just-resumed trade talks. But so far it appears quite clear that new aggressive policies are creating a cyberattack revival.

182,"Fast-growing video-streaming specialist iQiyi (IQ) has a lot to prove when it reports fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. iQiyi shares have plunged some 53% since peaking last spring. Often referred to as the “Netflix (NFLX) of China,” iQiyi has begun to trade like its U.S. rival. The leading streaming player in China went public some ten months ago priced at $18 per share. After closing on its first day of trading at just above $15 per share, iQiyi saw its value nearly triple by June, reaching $46 per share, only to give it all back after bottoming out around $14.35 in January. If that sounds a like new Netflix, iQiyi investors should be excited. But as with Netflix, it’s going to be a bumpy ride. On the bright side, iQiyi has already made a name for itself by capturing billions of eyeballs in the world's most populous country. But it has fallen victim to the U.S./China trade war spat. What’s more, China's weakening economy has analysts more cautious about the company’s ability to quickly turn a profit. Still, investors who have waited for a better entry point in iQiyi may want to consider the recent correction as a solid buying opportunity. As Netflix and Hulu has demonstrated, streaming video is here to stay. Plus, iQiyi is taking advantage and the binge-watching trend and continues to grow its premium subscriber base. So a strong top- and bottom-line beat Thursday, combined with upside guidance, can help the Chinese tech company regain some Wall Street love. For the three months that ended December, the Beijing-based tech company is expected to report a per-share loss of 65 cents per share on revenue of $982.51 million. This compares to the third quarter when it reported loss of 63 cents per share on revenue of $1.03 billion. For the full year, the per-share loss is expected to be $2.44, while full-year revenue is expected to reach $3.64 billion. In the last-reported quarter, the company delivered revenues that surged 48% year over year. Owing to its content portfolio strength, iQiyi saw strong demand for company-produced drama series as well as original movies, which drove an almost 90% surge in total subscribers which reached 80.7 million. The company also issued a strong Q4 revenue guidance range of $943.5 million to $982.8 million, which calls growth in the range of 43% to 49%. On Thursday investors and analysts will want to see if these momentum growth trends can continue. Investors will also look for any signs to suggest iQiyi can accelerate profitability, which analysts don't expect to see until 2022. In terms of valuations, iQiyi stock trades at about four times its trailing revenue, which is less than half of Netflix's multiple of 10. And given that iQiyi growing its business at a faster rate, there’s a chance the stock may catch up. That’s a risk-reward profile investors must reconcile.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 21, 2019, 08:13:52 AM EDT",iQiyi (IQ) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect
183,"Getty images Dropbox (DBX) will report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. The cloud content management company has quickly asserted itself as a leader within the fast-growing industry, specializing in storage and sharing of documents, photos and files. Dropbox, which makes money by selling cloud subscriptions to its product, delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines in the third quarter, reporting 11 cents per share on $360 million in revenue. And despite the company issuing upside Q4 guidance, investors are worried whether it can ultimately escape the shadows of its bigger competitors — namely Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). But Dropbox management understand these threats, announcing last month a deal to acquire HelloSign — an electronic signature and document workflow platform — for $230 million. With the deal, Dropbox is boosting its value proposition to its customer base, while differentiating itself from its competitors. In essence, the company is creating its self-described 'Dropbox flywheel' which it believes creates network effects. On Thursday the company must convince analysts that it can quickly bring synergy to this deal. For the three months that ended December, the San Francisco-based company is expected to earn 8 cents per share on revenue of $370.01 million. This compares to the previous quarter when earnings came to 11 cents per share on revenue of $360.3 million. For the full year, earnings are projected to be 38 cents per share, while full-year revenue is seen rising to $1.39 billion. While the threat from larger rivals is a real danger to Dropbox revenue potential, the company has tons of time to combat these threat, given the fact that it’s already profitable. Its deal to acquire HelloSign was the latest example of how it plans to utilize its profits and cash flow. That said, the company on Thursday will need to guide in a way that suggests confidence it can quickly extract value from the deal, given that HelloSign faced its own threats from industry giants DocuSign (DOCU) and Adobe (ADBE). Elsewhere, investors will want to see the fruits of the company’s continuous efforts to strengthen its capabilities in AI technologies, which should continue to drive revenues. The company has developed text-recognition features that allows users to quickly search documents even if they have been saved as images like JPEGs or PNGs. The feature will also recognize text in PDF files if they contain scans or photographs of the document. It remains to be seen how well these new features propel revenue growth. But the company’s focus on enhancing the user experience is one way to not only differentiate itself from competitors, but it also makes Dropbox a potential acquisition target of its own. From a valuation perspective, the stock — currently trading around $26 — is above its $21 IPO price and trades at 68 times fiscal 2018 EPS estimates, compared to a P/E of 18 for the S&P; 500 index. In other words, Dropbox has quite a bit to prove on Thursday.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 21, 2019, 08:11:13 AM EDT",Dropbox (DBX) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect

188,"By now, I am sure there is not a trader or investor alive who is unaware of cloud computing. Most probably even have a rudimentary understanding of what it means; the practice of storing and managing data on remote servers via an internet connection rather than on individual computers or private servers. In most cases, when that level of familiarity is reached in the tech sector, the real opportunities for investors are gone. With cloud computing though, that isn’t the case. Companies such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are still achieving substantial growth in the field, and there is no sign of it stopping yet. The battle for market share between those two tech giants receives a lot of publicity, but there is another, quieter battle for market share being waged to supply the most basic requirement of cloud computing: the processors. It is often said that the people who made the most money off of gold rushes were not the prospectors, but those that supplied the picks, pans and shovels to all of them, successful or not. On that basis, as the big players compete, the best bet for investors may well be to look at suppliers, who win whatever the outcome. That is why Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is so appealing right now.  So far, AMD’s efforts at capturing that market have not been a resounding success. They are way behind rival Intel (INTC) in terms of market share, but in some ways that is why AMD is preferred. INTC can, and almost undoubtedly will, grow substantially as the overall market increases, but the same can be said of AMD, with the added bonus of the potential to increase their share of the pie. Intel controls close to 80% of the processor market overall, with AMD supplying around 20%, but when it comes to server chips the gap is even wider. At the end of last year, AMD’s share of the server chip market was estimated at around 2%, with INTC having almost all the rest. There are two ways of looking at that. Either AMD is struggling and essentially failing, or they have a massive opportunity. With the market still growing, and with recent upgrades to existing products and new ones on the way, the second looks more realistic. Based on past successes, I wouldn’t discourage anyone from owning INTC at this point either, but in a sector where growth is king the law of large numbers comes into play, and it seems that AMD simply has more room to grow explosively. The company anticipates increasing their market share to around 5% before long, which still doesn’t sound like much, but is a 150% increase from their current position. From a technical perspective, the stock looks poised to break through some key resistance at around $25 which would give a short-term boost, and which makes now a good time to buy. Beyond that, there is another, more important short-term factor though, and that is the company’s performance in their core business of CP processors and video cards. Their forecast for this quarter in that area is downbeat, leaving room for an upside surprise. Overall, however, when earnings were released at the end of January, AMD forecast sales growth for this year in the high single digits, besting Wall Street’s estimate for 6% growth and any signs that that is achievable would also provide a short-term boost. Essentially though, this is a long-term play. Data collection, management and processing has gained in importance massively over the last few years and continues to do so. As that dynamic plays out, there are great opportunities for the suppliers to the boom, and AMD, as the fast-growing “upstart” in that area, looks poised to take advantage.",Martin Tillier,"February 20, 2019, 10:42:54 AM EDT",AMD Has Room to Grow in A Growing Business

""We   want to reward content consumption,"" said   Verizon Media    's head of entertainment and news Alex Wallace.  Yahoo    Play's main programming consists of 16 shows produced internally   at Verizon Media units including   Yahoo    Entertainment, Yahoo Lifestyle, Build Series, Makers and Ryot.   Each show invites viewers to play along and answer   multiple-choice questions in just a few seconds. Sounds like   HQ   Trivia    ? It does look a lot like it as well - with one key difference:   Yahoo Play shows are pre-recorded, with the idea that you can   play them any time you have a few minutes to spare. ""We may do   live for special events,"" said Wallace. But the main goal was to   make shows available 24/7, and not have players wait for   pre-scheduled events to participate.makeArticleAd(); Any time a viewer gets a question right, she earns a few   points of the app's in-game currency. These can then be traded in   against digital gift cards, with plans to add other shopping   opportunities down the line. However, Wallace stressed that the   main emphasis was on the game itself. ""Commerce is a secondary   part of it,"" she said.   Some of the shows available at launch include ""Beat the   Street,"" ""2 Tumblrs and a Lie,"" ""Planet Date,"" ""Celeb News Now""   and ""Celeb Said What?!"" In ""Beat the Street,"" hosts are quizzing   people on the street on pop culture and other factoids, and users   of the app have a chance to test their own knowledge at home. In addition to these main shows, Yahoo Play also comes with a   top row of Instagram-like stories called The Drop that features   short clips with news and gossip around pop culture moments.   Viewing these stories also earns you points, but not as many as   one can earn with a quiz show. Verizon Media head of product for news & entertainment   Matt Edelman said that his group had worked on the app for over a   year. Part of that work was dedicated to making sure that the   lure of gift card rewards doesn't prompt people to cheat, which   required trying to find loopholes before the app went live. ""We   have gamed the system in every single way,"" he said. ""Abuse   protection is a huge focus for us."" And there is another way Yahoo Play wants to make sure that   people care just as much about the game itself as the rewards,   while also getting them to frequently come back for more: The   number of earned points reset back to zero every Sunday   afternoon. ""Your point balance is ephemeral,"" said Edelman. At launch, Verizon Media is still producing all of Yahoo   Play's shows in-house, but Wallace said that    partnerships with third-party publishers, including outside   brands, are on the roadmap. And while Yahoo Play is a mobile   app-only experience, Verizon Media is also looking to promote it   widely across its existing sites and platforms.

Yahoo    Play's main programming consists of 16 shows produced internally   at Verizon Media units including   Yahoo    Entertainment, Yahoo Lifestyle, Build Series, Makers and Ryot.   Each show invites viewers to play along and answer   multiple-choice questions in just a few seconds. Sounds like   HQ   Trivia    ? It does look a lot like it as well - with one key difference:   Yahoo Play shows are pre-recorded, with the idea that you can   play them any time you have a few minutes to spare. ""We may do   live for special events,"" said Wallace. But the main goal was to   make shows available 24/7, and not have players wait for   pre-scheduled events to participate. Any time a viewer gets a question right, she earns a few   points of the app's in-game currency. These can then be traded in   against digital gift cards, with plans to add other shopping   opportunities down the line. However, Wallace stressed that the   main emphasis was on the game itself. ""Commerce is a secondary   part of it,"" she said.  Some of the shows available at launch include ""Beat the   Street,"" ""2 Tumblrs and a Lie,"" ""Planet Date,"" ""Celeb News Now""   and ""Celeb Said What?!"" In ""Beat the Street,"" hosts are quizzing   people on the street on pop culture and other factoids, and users   of the app have a chance to test their own knowledge at home. In addition to these main shows, Yahoo Play also comes with a   top row of Instagram-like stories called The Drop that features   short clips with news and gossip around pop culture moments.   Viewing these stories also earns you points, but not as many as   one can earn with a quiz show. Verizon Media head of product for news & entertainment   Matt Edelman said that his group had worked on the app for over a   year. Part of that work was dedicated to making sure that the   lure of gift card rewards doesn't prompt people to cheat, which   required trying to find loopholes before the app went live. ""We   have gamed the system in every single way,"" he said. ""Abuse   protection is a huge focus for us."" And there is another way Yahoo Play wants to make sure that   people care just as much about the game itself as the rewards,   while also getting them to frequently come back for more: The   number of earned points reset back to zero every Sunday   afternoon. ""Your point balance is ephemeral,"" said Edelman. At launch, Verizon Media is still producing all of Yahoo   Play's shows in-house, but Wallace said that    partnerships with third-party publishers, including outside   brands, are on the roadmap. And while Yahoo Play is a mobile   app-only experience, Verizon Media is also looking to promote it   widely across its existing sites and platforms. Said Wallace:   ""The beauty of Yahoo is its massive reach.""

191,"iStock photo Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), just added electric trucks and SUVs to its broad investment portfolio. Electric truck and SUV startup Rivian just announced that its $700 million funding round is being led by Amazon. The tech giant said that it's inspired by the electric pickup and SUV the company revealed in November at the Los Angeles Auto Show, but there seems to be more in it for the company. The Plymouth, Mich., startup is raising funds to finish development and launch production of the all-electric R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. Deliveries of these electric vehicles to customers in the U.S. are expected to begin in late 2020. “We’re inspired by Rivian’s vision for the future of electric transportation,” Amazon CEO Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a statement. “RJ has built an impressive organization, with a product portfolio and technology to match. We’re thrilled to invest in such an innovative company.” Amazon, like many global corporation, expects that electrified transportation will eventually become sizable with government emissions mandates increasing. But there’s another important angle for the company. Led by founder Jeff Bezos, Amazon has been quietly and steadily increasing its presence in the automotive sector — and clearly sees its role expanding as a leader in logistic and delivery. The investor group Amazon is leading for Rivian also includes the investment arm of Abdul Latif Jameel IPR Co. Ltd., a Saudi Arabian conglomerate whose holdings include a major Toyota car and truck distributorship. Sumitomo Corp. also has invested in Rivian. General Motors had been eyeing the startup as an investment, but was not named as part of the Amazon funding deal. In recent years, Amazon has been increasing its presence as a major technology partner to vehicle manufacturers. Amazon’s Alexa system that connects smart phone apps to car dashboards is becoming common in new vehicle offerings. The Alexa Auto SDK will be offered soon and includes all the core Alexa functions like streaming media, smart home controls, weather reports, and will be receiving new features just right for auto users like navigation and search, Amazon says. It ties well into its popular services such as Amazon Music that can be played by drivers going to work. Bezos sees Amazon playing a leading role in autonomous vehicles and supply chain management. That’s likely one of the appealing angles of its investment in Rivian. The startup also has operations in San Jose and Irvine, Calif., where engineers are working on autonomous vehicle technology. Apple's major presence in cloud computing could play a big part in autonomous vehicles through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. AWS has a long list of corporate customers including global automakers, Tier 1 automotive suppliers and mobility company startups. Its “secure, agile and scalable platform can help accelerate your pace of innovation, improve your security posture and lower your IT cost structure,” Amazon’s website pitches to potential clients. The tech giant has been exploring its place in the global logistics sector, which Transparency Market Research expects to reach $15.5 trillion by 2023. Amazon isn’t planning on taking over that market space, but is looking for revenue streams and operating cost cutting opportunities in its role as the most prominent and pervasive shopping website in the world — with next day delivery of packages right to your doorstep. XPO Logistics appears to be losing sizable income and stock value from its major client, Amazon, with the client pulling away and getting into its own delivery services. Delivery giants FedEx and UPS have been downplaying the threat from Amazon, but are watching closely to see if more threats will emerge — including Amazon’s leading role in delivery postage in the U.S. that has provoked anger from President Donald Trump. One way that Amazon will be cutting costs and increasing income on the delivery front is through its flying drones. That will be taking place through Amazon Prime Air, a service that will deliver packages up to five pounds in 30 minutes or less using its small drones. The tech giant hasn’t specified when it will become a service available to the public. Amazon and UPS are competing to offer the best delivery drones, with both companies testing package delivery that could drastically cut operating costs in the near future. In late 2017, Amazon was awarded a patent that could benefits buyers of electric trucks and vans from Rivian. The patent will allow the company to create a drone that can charge electric vehicles, including EVs that are still in driving mode and need more power to get to a charging station. The patent granted to the tech giant also includes a rooftop docking station that the drone can land on to stay connected with the EV and provide power while it continues the trip. It would mean working directly with automakers to be adaptable to the technology, or making aftermarket modifications. Amazon clearly sees EVs tying into its vision as a global leader in logistics and delivery at an affordable price.

193,"The news is out, a major international bank is backing – and releasing – its own cryptocurrency. Well, sort of. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM – Research Report) will be starting trials, over the next few months, of the JPM Coin – a blockchain-based trading token backed by US dollar deposits. The announcement came on February 14. The new coin will be used to facilitate money transfers between the bank’s customers. This move into the cryptocurrency world is definitely something of a surprise, as JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin (BTC) a “fraud” and “stupid” back in 2017. In fact, he said, “I wouldn’t put this high in the category of ‘important things in the world.’” So, what is his bank – one of the world’s major financial institutions – doing, flying the face of the CEO’s conviction? Loving Blockchain The answer lies in the technology. Dimon obviously has little use for Bitcoin and other cryptos – his bank has banned credit card cryptocurrency purchases by customers – but he does like the blockchain. “The blockchain is real,” he told Fox Business. “You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that.” Clearly, Dimon at the very least sees blockchain as a viable mode for transmission of traditional currencies. As a JPMorgan spokesperson put it, “Jamie has been more consistent than people give him credit for. He’s always separated cryptocurrency from the underlying value and the use of blockchain.” Dimon’s and his bank’s stance puts the JPM Coin into better perspective. The new coin will be a non-fluctuating trading token, tied to and redeemable in US dollars deposited by the token’s users. It’s a concept similar to stablecoins, but quite identical. What Sets JPM Coin Apart The main difference lies in the nature of the blockchain behind the token. Where ‘traditional’ blockchain is open to the public, JPM Coin will be backed by a closed system, accessible to the bank’s officers and customers, by permission only. It’s not a fully centralized system, but neither is it the open-source free-for-all that have made cryptos notorious. Another difference lies in the new coin’s use. Where cryptos like Bitcoin are intended to circulate, the JPM Coin is intended to facilitate circulation; each token is redeemable in US dollars, and after it is used in a transfer transaction and redeemed at the other end, the token is destroyed by the bank. JPM Coin is not a freely circulation alternative currency. In short, JPM Coin will be an internal blockchain system for use by JPMorgan Chase bank and its customers, making available the speed and security of blockchain digital currency transfers. It seems, in fact, like a hard swipe at the existing SWIFT system, and the attractions of a fast, international currency transfer should be immediately apparent to anyone who has spent time waiting for SWIFT transfers to post to an account. That alone should generate substantial interest from JPMorgan’s institutional customers. Who is Line to Use JPM Coin Umar Farooq, head of blockchain projects at JPMorgan Chase, says of the new trading token, “Anything that currently exists in the world, as that moves onto the blockchain, this would be the payment leg for that transaction. The applications are frankly quite endless; anything where you have a distributed ledger which involves corporations or institutions can use this.” Specifically, JPMorgan sees three sets of institutional clients for the new digital coin: The new JPM Coin is not designed for the bank’s retail customers. Rather, it is intended as a tool for institutional use, to smooth out and speed up the bank’s largest money movements. Staying in Line with Regulation JPMorgan spokesmen have been clear that the bank’s new blockchain token will be fully complaint with international currency regulation. In a statement, the bank said, “We have always believed in the potential of blockchain technology and we are supportive of cryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated. As a globally regulated bank, we believe we have a unique opportunity to develop the capability in a responsible way with the oversight of our regulators.” This will include tracking all information required by governmental regulators, and ensuring that all clients using JPM’s blockchain are approved, and have passed money-laundering clearances. We’ll leave the last word to the bank’s Farooq. “There is a possibility in the future of a blockchain that is private, except from the regulator. There are various ways to make the regulatory regimes across the world stronger over time.” Author: Michael Marcus",TipRanks,"February 19, 2019, 02:34:56 PM EDT",What Is The New JP Morgan Coin All About?

198,"The future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has been a hot topic since Bitcoin crashed in December 2017. Everyone has an opinion. INVAO looks at the facts. Author: Frank Wagner, CEO and Co-founder of  INVAO “Bitcoin will go to zero,” said Jeff Schumacher from BCG Digital Ventures at the World Economic Forum in January. He was not the only one making such harsh predictions for cryptocurrencies, at what some consider to be the world’s most elite annual gathering. And indeed, the market has been bearish all year round. But, here is what many don’t understand: Cryptos are not dead and what’s happening right now is actually quite normal. Blockchain technology on the Gartner Hype Cycle The technology consulting firm Gartner has come up with the  Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies . According to this theory, most new technologies go through the same 5 stages: Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment and Plateau of Productivity.  The cycle helps to explain the development of the internet over the last three decades. A comparison between the early days of the internet and the current state of blockchain might not be exact, but there are similarities. For example, the early fascination with the technology, instead of a focus on practical solutions. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the “Peak of Inflated Expectations” was, most likely, when Bitcoin stood at $19,783 in December 2017. If blockchain technology is going to develop according to the Gartner Hype Cycle, there is light at the end of the tunnel. There are two primary reasons to believe that this positive development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the future will happen. Firstly, decentralization will become a long-term trend. And secondly, there are several promising signs that blockchain is primed for mass adoption. Decentralization will become a long-term trend Decentralization is going to become one of the most dominant trends in the 21 st  century. New technologies could greatly enhance transparency, reduce costs, and increase our independence from central institutions. With the introduction of the internet, various forms of a “shared economy” emerged, for example through peer-to-peer lending platforms. Despite this development, the internet’s “shared economy” is not decentralized. There are many ‘middlemen’ involved, and some of these have created massive centralized data monopolies. As a result, corporations and governments often have access to our data and may use it for purposes that are outside of our control. Decentralization has the power to reverse this trend. In the past, Open Source Protocols often created value for users, but not for developers. Blockchain-based token systems have changed this, allowing developers to monetize decentralized platforms. In the future, we will see more of these systems being introduced into the marketplace as developers take advantage of this opportunity. Blockchain technology is primed for mass adoption While some do think the value of Bitcoin will go to zero, the data suggests otherwise. The number of on-chain transactions and the percentage of high-value cross-border transactions have been increasing. More trading activity means more dynamic markets and increased proliferation of the technology. Corporations are also investing more resources into global cryptocurrency mining, which supports the value of cryptocurrencies. A second trend that points towards long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies is the fact that many governments have begun to create a legal basis for the technology. More nations are introducing crypto regulations, including Singapore, Russia, France, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Transnational regulations are also being discussed. In December 2018, two leading European financial market watchdogs advised the EU-Commission to investigate pan-European regulation of digital assets. Thirdly, large corporations are implementing blockchain projects. The World Economic Forum has forecasted that  10%  of the global GDP will be based on blockchain technology by 2025. Moreover, institutional investors, who have so far stayed away from blockchain technology, have signaled their readiness to pour funds into the industry. Fidelity, for example, one of the five largest financial services firm globally, will offer crypto custodian and trading services via its newly formed subsidiary Fidelity Digital Asset Services LLC. Morgan Stanley, a leading Wall Street bank, has recently declared cryptocurrencies an institutional asset class. Next stage: the Slope of Enlightenment Going back to the Gartner Hype Cycle, we are currently somewhere in the Trough of Disillusionment. Maybe we have already seen the bottom of it, maybe not. It doesn’t matter — what is important is understanding how the journey will continue. Once institutional investors enter the field, increased funding will propel the industry’s development forward. We will also see simplified investment products, that will make it  easy for unsophisticated retail investors to invest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies  without the need to fully understand the technical details. As soon as the first blockchain startups have successfully established themselves in the market, second-generation products and services will emerge. That’s already happening in today’s crypto markets, where new coins are building on the value proposition of existing coins while solving some of their challenges. The Slope of Enlightenment is not far away — we might already be there. From here, the industry can only move forward, and it might accelerate faster than most of us think. Who would have thought in the early 2000s, that an online dictionary showing personal profiles could one day become a big thing? Now we all have Facebook profiles and the company is worth $470 billion.",Guest Contributors,"February 15, 2019, 01:53:56 PM EDT",Look beyond Bear Markets: Why Crypto Is Here to Stay
