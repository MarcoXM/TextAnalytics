2," April 19 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd  said on Friday a report by the Nikkei that it would slash production this year was ""completely incorrect"" and that it had lodged a complaint with the business daily, in an unusually strong denial of a media report in Japan. The comment came after the Nikkei, revered in Japan for its business news and known for its market-moving scoops and previews, said Nissan would cut its global production by about 15 percent for the current fiscal year ending March 2020. The move would mark a shift away from the aggressive expansion campaign promoted by ousted former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the Nikkei said. ""Nissan's production plan for the current fiscal year will be disclosed on May 14, when the company announces its financial results for the previous fiscal year,"" said the maker of the Rogue sport-utility vehicle and Altima sedan. The Nikkei, which also owns Britain'sFinancial Times newspaper, confirmed it had received the complaint from Nissan. It said it would continue to cover the issue and promptly report all the facts once they become clear. The newspaper had earlier reported that Nissan aimed to produce about 4.6 million units in fiscal 2019, citing plans being communicated to the automaker's suppliers. The move was likely to impact earnings and could cast a pall over Nissan's alliance with French automaker Renault SA , the Nikkei said without elaborating. That would be the steepest production cut in more than a decade by the Japanese automaker, as it battles weak sales in overseas markets including the United States where it plans to scale back sales operations, according to the Nikkei. Earlier this year, Nissan, which has been battling falling sales, lowered its operating profit forecast for the current fiscal year to 450 billion yen ($4 billion), 22 percent lower than a year earlier. It would be Nissan's lowest profit since 2013. Japanese companies typically respond to media reports by saying they were not the source of the information and, depending on the content of the report, that they may be considering various options and that nothing had been decided. It is rare for a Japanese firm to say it has issued a strong rebuke to a media outlet. Shares in Nissan, mired in a financial misconduct scandal involving Ghosn and the company itself, closed down 2.2 percent on Friday, versus a 0.5 percent rise in the broader market .",,"April 19, 2019, 03:20:00 AM EDT",Nissan slams output cut report as 'completely incorrect',0,0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,1,-1

4," By Hyunjoo Jin and Sanjana  Shivdas SEOUL, April 19 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co  has appointed Jose Munoz as global chief operating officer and Americas chief, tapping a man formerly considered an ally and potential successor of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's  ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Munoz is the latest foreign executive to be brought in to a South Korean automaker dominated by lifelong loyalists, as heir-apparent Euisun Chung strengthens control of the conglomerate chaired by his aging father. It also comes as Munoz's former boss at Nissan sits in a Tokyo jail awaiting trial for financial misconduct. The November arrest of Ghosn, who denies wrongdoing, prompted an internal investigation into corporate governance at the Japanese automaker in which Munoz was cited as a ""person of interest"". Munoz resigned in January, saying Nissan was involved in matters that would divert its focus and that he looked forward to continuing to assist with investigations. At the time, he was Nissan'sChina head and chief performance officer - responsible for Nissan's results and global strategies - having previously overseen operations in North America. At his new employer, Munoz will succeed William Lee, who has led Hyundai's North America business since June. On May 1, he will effectively assume two newly created roles: Global Chief Operating Officer and Head of Hyundai Motor Americas Region. ""(Munoz's) focus will be to deliver profitable growth and to improve overall performance of Hyundai Motor,"" the automaker said in a statement issued on Thursday in the United States. He will be based in California and report to ""top leadership"" in Seoul, Hyundai said.  OUTSIDERS Since the promotion last year of Euisun Chung, the 48-year-old Hyundai Motor Group scion has in turn promoted executives brought in from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and automakers including Germany'sBMW AG . ""Hyundai needs to change, but it is changing too fast, which could lead to internal conflicts and communication problems,"" said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. ""If the Ghosn scandal is not resolved well, the appointment could adversely affect the company's image and lead to doubts about Chung's personnel management capability,"" he said. Munoz, 53, joined Nissan in 2004 in Europe and led its expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Nissan raised its U.S. market share under Munoz and posted record sales, though sales have since weakened. Hyundai, meanwhile, was an outperformer during the 2009 global economic downturn but has seen its U.S. market share slip in recent years, in part due to its delayed response to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles.",,"April 18, 2019, 09:20:00 PM EDT","Hyundai hires former Ghosn ally Munoz as global COO, Americas head",0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,1,1,0
5," By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 (Reuters) - Uber's autonomous vehicle unit has raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including SoftBank Group Corp , giving the company a much-needed funding boost for its pricey self-driving ambitions on the eve of its public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc  said on Thursday that the investment valued its Advanced Technologies Group, which works to develop autonomous driving technology, at $7.25 billion. SoftBank will invest $333 million from its $100 billionVision Fund, while Toyota Motor Corp and automotive company Denso Corp will combined invest $667 million. The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some investor concerns over Uber's spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1 billion since the program started in 2016. The business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion. The company is not even offering free rides in the robot cars to passengers, like some of its rivals are, following a fatal crash last year in Arizona involving an Uber self-driving SUV. Uber released its IPO filing this month and is preparing to launch is ""roadshow,"" when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Uber is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation, at least an 18 percent jump from its current $76 billion valuation. As part of the deal, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber with its financial performance folded into Uber's. A new ATG board will be formed, with six seats from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board. Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company's capital structure. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). A law enacted last year expands that group's powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defense applications.",,"April 18, 2019, 08:30:00 PM EDT","Uber lands $1 billion from SoftBank, Toyota for self-driving unit",0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
6," April 18 (Reuters) - American Media Inc (AMI)  said on Thursday it was selling its National Enquirer tabloid to James Cohen, whose family owns a magazine distributor and used to own the Hudson chain of airport newsstands. The National Enquirer had admitted to paying hush money to help U.S. President Donald Trump get elected and been accused of attempting to blackmail Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The weekly tabloid, along with two of its sister publications, will be purchased by Cohen. The Washington Post reported the sale was for $100 million. The companies did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on the price. The deal comes a week after AMI said it was looking at ""strategic options"" for the National Enquirer as well as for the Globe and National Examiner brands. The sale is expected to reduce AMI's debt to $355 million. Last week, the New York Times reported that owners of the National Enquirer were in talks to sell the tabloid to  California-based billionaire Ronald Burkle.

On Tuesday, Pope dropped his bid to buy the supermarket tabloid from American Media, the New York Post reported.

""It's a media-rich utility that satisfies both emotional and   functional needs by solving a widespread consumer problem that is   unaddressed by many other platforms,"" the filing continued. ""We   call it discovery."" Despite that insistence that its focus on visual discovery   sets it apart from other social platforms, it's clear that   Pinterest actually has a lot in common with social media   companies like Facebook. This includes a focus on advertising as   its primary source of revenue, as well as a desire to grow video   on its platform to scale that advertising revenue. The   IPO prospectus    filing includes multiple mentions of plans to ""develop and   increase the use of certain products, such as video."" The   document also lays out risk factors specific to a video   expansion, including a lack of net neutrality protections and   other issues that could impede mobile video growth.

17," By Nandita Bose WASHINGTON, April 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it has launched a pilot program in New York that allows consumers dependant on food stamps to use them to buy groceries online, a move that is likely to boost sales at retailers like Walmart Inc  and Amazon.com Inc . Both companies are participating in the initial pilot launch with Wakefern Food Corp'sShopRite supermarket chain expected to join the program early next week, the USDA said. Walmart will offer the service in upstate New York, while ShopRite and Amazon will service the New York City area. ""People who receive SNAP benefits should have the opportunity to shop for food the same way more and more Americans shop for food - by ordering and paying for groceries online,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, already has 40 stores in other parts of the country that allow shoppers to pay for groceries ordered online using food stamps. The new program will expand to Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington, and additional  retailers are expected to take part, the USDA said. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company has nearly 275 stores that offer grocery pickup in the nine states eligible for the pilot. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, in a blog post on Thursday said New York customers can shop on AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry without requiring a membership fee. ""Amazon believes the program will dramatically increase access to food for more remote customers and help to mitigate the public health crisis of food deserts,"" the retailer said.",,"April 18, 2019, 12:56:00 PM EDT",U.S. pilot program allows online grocery shopping with food stamps,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,-1,1,0
18," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There are two pieces of very good news this week if you are an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investor worried slumping iPhone sales could get even worse. The first was a dramatic end to the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) lawsuit, saving the day for the prospect of 5G iPhones next year. The second had nothing to do with Apple, but it's sure taking some pressure off AAPL's incremental approach to smartphone design. Samsung's new $1,980 Galaxy Fold smartphone was released to reviewers this week and quickly ran into a storm of negative press. The smartphone with the futuristic new folding screen has suffered catastrophic failure for multiple high profile journalists.  Depending on how this plays out, Samsung's growing PR problem is likely to be good news for Apple stock. At the end of February, Samsung made a big splash with the announcement of the Galaxy Fold. The company's new flagship smartphone featured a futuristic Infinity Flex folding display that transformed it from a phone to a 7.3-inch tablet. Launching on April 26, the radical new smartphone would be priced starting at a whopping $1,980. It would also be the first folding smartphone to be widely commercially available in the U.S. China's Huawei has also announced a folding smartphone - but the company lacks an American presence. So far, so good for Samsung. The company was in the spotlight once again, smartphones were cool once again (after a year where global smartphone sales had been sliding), and Samsung was looking like the industry design and engineering leader - after years of being pegged as an iPhone copycat . Then the Galaxy Fold review units went out. Within a day,Â the reports of broken displays began to arrive. The Verge's Dieter Bohn reported his review unit's folding display developed a bulge then its OLED display failed after just one day of use . Bloomberg's Mark Gurman posted that his Galaxy Fold was "" completely broken and unusable just two days in. "" Again it was a failure of the folding display. CNBC's review attempt ended when the Galaxy Fold they were given was "" completely unusable after just two days of use. "" And there were more. It's possible the reviewers all received phones from an initial batch that suffered a manufacturing defect. It's also possible that Samsung's folding screen design is flawed and not ready for prime time. Samsung issued a terse statement to The Verge : ""A limited number of early Galaxy Fold samples were provided to media for review. We have received a few reports regarding the main display on the samples provided. We will thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter. Separately, a few reviewers reported having removed the top layer of the display causing damage to the screen. The main display on the Galaxy Fold features a top protective layer, which is part of the display structure designed to protect the screen from unintended scratches. Removing the protective layer or adding adhesives to the main display may cause damage. We will ensure this information is clearly delivered to our customers.""  Company representatives also told The Verge they plan to continue with the Galaxy Fold's April 26 U.S. launch. For Samsung, this is bad news. Comparisons have already been made to the Galaxy Note 7 disaster of 2016 that decimated the company's smartphone profits and allowed Apple to surpass Samsung as the world's top-selling smartphone maker - at least for one quarter . It's not on the same level in the sense that the Galaxy Fold screen break isn't a safety issue, but at $1,980 a pop and with pre-orders selling out almost immediately , the company is facing a big PR issue and the possibility of a release delay (or a recall if it goes ahead as planned) while it investigates what's going wrong. For Apple, the very public and very rapid failure of multiple Galaxy Fold review units is nothing but good news. Apple stock has been under pressure from slowing iPhone sales. And with rivals like Samsung and Huawei showing off radical new folding smartphone flagships this year, AAPL's iPhones were looking far from exciting. If the initial Galaxy Fold failures develop into a full-scale debacle, the lack of its own folding smartphone at this time will turn from Apple falling behind , to Apple avoiding gimmicks and sticking with solid, proven engineering. Incremental design updates may be boring, but quality and reliability is something that Apple can leverage as it works to boost iPhone sales. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

20,"iStock The electric bus revolution is about to take off. While the prospect of major advances in electric buses receive a small fraction of the attention that electric vehicles receive, the potential for a major transformation is arguably much closer. As with EVs, electric buses promise lower life-cycle costs when compared to their gasoline and diesel counterparts, but upfront costs remain painfully high. However, Proterra, an electric bus manufacturer, is rolling out leasing plans that could eliminate this barrier. Proterra and Mitsui & Co. areÂ teaming upÂ to lease the batteries in electric buses so that the upfront costs of an electric bus reaches parity with a traditional diesel bus. In other words, no upfront cost for the battery, just monthly lease payments over the lifespan of the vehicle. The monthly payments would be offset by the fuel savings. It is the same approach that solar developers began using years ago: no upfront cost, just lease payments over time. A 2018Â analysisÂ from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) predicted that while EVs would capture nearly a third of the total auto market by the 2030 â a bold prediction, to be sure â electric buses would gain acceptance must faster. By 2030, electric buses overwhelm the bus market, taking 84 percent of total sales. In one scenario, BNEF sees electric buses reaching upfrontÂ cost parityÂ with conventional buses on an unsubsidized basis by the mid-2020s. The CEO of Proterra toldÂ AxiosÂ in a March interview that he doesnât actually see electric buses ever reaching cost parity with diesel buses, but not for the reasons one might think. âI donât think weâll ever get all the way there, because I actually think that once weâre within a 2-year fuel payback, the diesel bus market goes extinct,â Proterraâs chief executive Ryan Popple said. Still, the steeper upfront cost today is one of the largest hurdles. Mitsui has agreed to provide a $200 million credit facility to help launch Proterraâs battery leasing program. A new diesel bus can cost about $500,000 while also incurring around $1 million in maintenance and fuel costs over its lifetime, according to Proterraâs Ryan Popple andÂ Greentech Media. In contrast, one of Proterraâs electric buses costs $750,000 upfront, but will have maintenance costs that are 20 percent lower than a diesel bus. By adding in a lease for the battery, the electric bus can make sense right away, rather than having a long payback period. âOn a percent basis, it takes the upfront premium for an electric bus from 50 percent to zero,â Popple told Greentech Media. âYou eliminate $250,000 of capital acquisition premium that you traditionally paid to invest in a higher-efficiency electric bus.â Electric buses may have an easier time gaining traction than passenger EVs for several reasons. They drive longer distances, which means the fuel savings add up over a shorter period of time. They cover predictable routes, making it easier to locate and build recharging infrastructure. Perhaps most importantly, the customers tend to be municipalities or corporations, rather than individuals. These entities can take a long-term view, and make practical decisions around life-cycle costs. China accounts for the vast majority of electric buses on the roads worldwide. The U.S. market is still small, although growing quickly. As of 2017, fewer than 500 electric buses were sold in the U.S. But Proterra told Greentech Media that demand is strong and it already has 45 new orders this year, including from repeat customers. Portland, Oregon, justÂ deployedÂ its first electric bus this week, a bus manufactured by Winnipeg-based New Flyer. Portland hasÂ planÂ to switch its nearly 700-bus fleet from diesel to electric by 2040. More and more cities are opting to do the same. The impact on the oil market could be more profound from buses than from EVs, at least in the short- and medium-term. According toÂ BNEF, electric buses (again, mostly in China) will displace about 270,000 barrels of diesel demand per day in 2019, while EVs will only displace a little more than 80,000 bpd of gasoline and diesel demand. Elon Musk and Tesla tend to soak up an inordinate share of media attention when it comes to electrifying the transportation sector, but e-buses are having a larger impact.

32," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be having issues with iPhone sales and an underwhelming response to new services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+, but the company is doing quite well with its AirPods. However, that success - and the rapidly growing wireless earbud market - is bringing out competitors. The latest tech giant to be making a play for the AirPods' market is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which is reportedly working on what may end up being named ""Surface Buds.""  Consumer demand for wireless earbuds has been growing, helped by the trend started by Apple of eliminating the headphone jack in smartphones. It's expected to hit $10 billion by 2023 . That being said, the big upside for Microsoft stock isn't just the potential revenue in play by selling Surface Buds, it's also something much bigger. Thurrott , a website known for breaking MSFT product news, is reporting that the company is currently working on a new product with the code-name ""Morrison. "" According to Thurrott's multiple un-named sources, Morrison is a set of wireless earbuds that may end up being called Surface Buds when released (potentially in 2019). They are expected to have Cortana onboard, and could incorporate advanced capabilities like noise cancellation and tech that's described as a way to ""improve interactions between a phone and the earbuds to make reading content easier on the phone."" Whatever that last feature actually is (and whether it makes it into the production version), the core concept should sound pretty familiar by now: The so-called Surface Buds are aimed squarely at Apple's AirPods. If the idea of MSFT making earbuds seems farfetched, remember that last fall the company launched Surface Headphones . These are premium priced ($349.99) wireless headphones with active noise cancellation, touch controls and - most importantly - Cortana on board. That's where the real upside for Microsoft stock lies, the Cortana integration. When Apple introduced the AirPods alongside the iPhone X in 2017, the bizarre-looking wireless earbuds were widely mocked. It didn't take long before traditional earbud manufacturers realized their mistake, though. AirPods were a surprise success and demand went through the roof. AirPods currently hold 60% of the global market for true wireless earbuds , and in March the company released its second generation version with hands-free Siri. And it's Siri that has caught the attention of the big tech competitors like MSFT. These companies realize that Apple is following the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) playbook, sneaking Siri into a popular product category the way AMZN added Alexa to a wireless speaker with the Echo. They've seen how that's played out, with the explosion in smart speaker popularity driving up Alexa's popularity - despite the fact that Amazon has no horse in the smartphone race.  Since the AirPods were first announced, we've seen Pixel Buds (with Google Assistant onboard) from Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Galaxy Buds from Samsung with Samsung's Bixby voice assistant baked in. Amazon is reportedly working on Alexa wireless earbuds , in a move that could extend its reach to the smartphone. Microsoft releasing Surface Buds would follow that same pattern and the move would offer the same prize that Amazon is shooting for. With Microsoft's own smartphone ambitions shattered - on both the hardware and Windows front - selling consumers a set of Surface Buds is a way to get Cortana into use on smartphones. Getting Cortana into more widespread adoption has huge advantages for MSFT. With machine learning, the more a voice assistant is used, the smarter it gets. The more popular it is, the higher the likelihood third-party electronics manufacturers will offer support in their products, such as smart home devices. Cortana uses Microsoft's Bing search engine by default, and that opens the door for ad and search placement revenue potential ( paid Bing search netted MSFT $1.8 billion in 2017 ) when Surface Bud owners start asking for things like nearby restaurants or movie recommendations. Surface Buds may sound like a niche product, but they're MSFT's play to regain a mobile foothold - with billions of smartphones potentially in play. If the company can convince consumers that Surface Buds are superior to AirPods or Pixel Buds, Cortana adoption has a chance to grow. Added to the revenue hardware from selling the earbuds, that would be good news for Microsoft stock. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

34,"Shutterstock photo To what extent can Netflix (NFLX) fight off threats from emerging streaming platforms from media titans Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA) asset NBCUniversal? Netflix is set to report first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results Tuesday after the closing bell. As is often the case, Netflixâs Q1 results will be the first among its FAANG peers â Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG , GOOGL), to be released and could set the tone for what the group is expected to do. For Netflix, however, the company will be asked to respond amid the recent unveiling of Disneyâs streaming platform. Disney last week finally announced details about its upcoming streaming service, dubbed Disney+. The service, which will cost $6.99 per month, or $69.99 for an annual plan, is expected to be ready on Nov. 12, delivering a combination of original content and offerings from Disney's extensive libraries as well as content it now owns via its Fox acquisition. Analysts remain positive that Netflixâs first-mover advantage wonât disrupt its long-term growth story. This is especially after Netflix has recently raised prices for its subscriptions in the U.S., raising the price of both its basic and standard plans by $1, while its premium offering was increased by $2. Netflix believes it has made the necessary investments in original content (both movies and TV shows) to maintain its status the streaming movie leader. On Tuesday it can allay competitive concerns by delivering solid subscriber additions for both domestic and international markets and upbeat guidance. For the quarter that ended March, Wall Street expects Netflix to earn 57 cents per share on revenue of $4.5 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were 64 cents per share on $3.7 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, earnings are projected to rise 51% to $4.05 per share, while full-year revenue of $20.21 billion would mark an increase of 28% year over year. Netflix shares have risen more than 30% year to date, despite expectations of a conservative quarter. This is because the company added 30 million net new subscribers in 2018, thanks to its international push, and it is expected to add at least another 30 million this year. For the just-ended quarter, Wall Street expects the company to add global subscriber additions of 8.94 billion. And it is expected to outline plans to secure and maintain its massive slice of that market. The good news is the rapidly growing movie streaming market is expected to gain steam in the years ahead, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20% from 2018 to 2025 and reach $124.57 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research. This is especially notable since average revenue per user is expected to rise from $91.37 in 2019 to $98.64 by 2023, according to Statista. All told, the companyâs aggressive investment in original content is paying off as evidenced by its projected growth rate and the fact that it has begun to see increased competition, which further solidifies its working business model. Combined with its recent price hike, which will be used to fund its multibillion-dollar original content plans, Netflix it assured to remain a dominant platform despite these emerging new threats.",Richard Saintvilus,"April 16, 2019, 08:17:07 AM EDT",Netflix (NFLX) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,-1,-1,0
35," Following its 2017 release of the ""Star Wars: Jedi Challenges"" augmented reality ( AR ) headset, Lenovo and Disney seem to be preparing the release of hardware related to yet another blockbuster franchise: A new FCC filing suggests that the companies are getting close to unveil a Marvel -themed AR headset. The heavily-redacted filing describes controllers for a ""Mirage 1.5"" device, suggesting that it is part of Lenovo 's immersive media hardware (the company's Daydream VR headset, 180-degree camera and ""Star Wars"" AR headset were all marketed under the Mirage branding). A document included in the filing further mentions a ""standalone Marvel controller"" as well as a ""Marvel package."" What's more, the controller for the ""Star Wars"" headset used the model number AAC151B. The controller in the new filing is numbered AAC161B. Spokespeople for Lenovo and Marvel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Lenovo's ""Star Wars: Jedi Challenges"" combined a head-mounted display (pictured above) with a user's cell phone to super-impose images of ""Star Wars"" characters over the physical world. The device shipped with two light saber controllers, giving consumers a chance to battle Darth Vader, Kylo Ren and others. Originally priced $200, the headset now retails for $79. At launch in late 2017, Disney advanced development VP Mike Goslin already suggested that the two companies may eventually bring other Disney franchises to the headset as well. Â In fact, the original headset already included buttons not necessary to play the ""Star Wars"" AR games. The new FCC filings suggest that Lenovo may simply be selling Marvel-themed controllers to anyone who already owns ""Star Wars: Jedi Challenges,"" allowing them to play games for both franchises with the same headset. In addition, Lenovo is likely going to sell a bundle with the headset and 2 controllers.

38," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) held its special event in March, the company's new Apple+ video streaming service was clearly front and center. According to a report released over the weekend, another of the AAPL subscription service announced at that event is seeing a huge investment from the company, with analysts predicting it will eclipse Apple TV+ revenue. Apple Arcade may not have been in the same spotlight that Apple TV+ enjoyed, but it could prove to be the new release with a bigger impact on Apple stock.  On March 25, Apple held its first special event of 2019 , and as expected, its Apple TV+ video streaming service was the star of the show. The company is spending upward of a billion dollars on original content for Apple TV+ this year, making it a very big bet. Also announced at the March event was Apple Arcade. AAPL's new video game subscription service is coming this fall, and it is promised to have 100 or more exclusive game titles at launch. The intent of the video game subscription service appears to be to further monetize the App Store's long-held lead in mobile gaming, and to appeal to gamers who are tired of free-to-play titles with endless in-app purchases required. Apple Arcade got less attention. Not only because AAPL kept the spotlight on Apple TV+, but also because Apple Arcade seemed like a half-baked concept (will iPhone owners actually pay for games?), and pricing details were not released. It will also be going up against other new subscription-based gaming services when it launches, including the much more heavily hyped Stadia from Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google. A report over the weekend from the Financial Times (via AppleInsider ) suggests Apple Arcade is a much bigger initiative than it seemed on the surface. The $1 billion the company is investing in original programming for Apple TV+, which is seen as a big deal, but according to the Financial Times report, AAPL is also spending $500 million to ensure Apple Arcade has a full slate of exclusive games at launch. The level of investment in the service wasn't really clear from the original announcement and it suggests Apple is serious about its new gaming service. The report also says AAPL is offering incentives to game publishers - spending more money - to ensure their titles have a window of exclusivity on Apple Arcade, and will continue doing so beyond the service's launch. Also included in the Financial Times report were predictions from HSBC analysts. Apple didn't release pricing for Apple Arcade, but the HSBC analysts are predicting it will cost $12.99 per month. At that price, they are estimating that by 2024, Apple Arcade could have 29 million subscribers and bring in $4.5 billion in annual revenue. In comparison, they see Apple TV+ generating $4.1 billion in annual revenue by 2024, while the Apple News+ news and subscription service hit $2.7 billion. In other words, Apple Arcade is being seen as the bigger win - despite the higher spending on Apple TV+ and the much higher level of media and public attention on the video streaming service. With softening iPhone sales, the company's Services division is increasingly important and subscriptions are seen as a key way to leverage the billion+ Apple devices already out there. AAPL sees Services revenue as being critical to boosting revenue and driving Apple stock's value. And it's possible that Apple Arcade may turn out to be the real star of that Services division.

46," âA nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people.â ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt Forests are often dubbed as the âlungs of our planetâ and this defines how important they are for us. Yet over the years, the earthâs forest cover has declined at an alarming rate. Around 18.7 million acres of forest are lost annually which is equivalent to 27Â soccer fields every minute. There are a number of reasons for it. While efforts have been made by conservationists, institutions and governments to combat deforestation, they have fallen short and problems still persist. In an era when advanced technologies (such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence) are becoming a part of varied industries, there is increasing evidence of how these technologies can contribute towards solving globally pressing issues such as deforestation. Hereâs how. Today, approximately 31 percent of the earthâs land surface is covered by forests which is equivalent to about 4 billion hectares of land. This is much lower than the pre-industrial area of 5.9 billion hectares. The main behind the decline in the green cover over the years are logging (legal and illegal), agricultural expansion, mining, urbanization and infrastructure expansion (such as roads). Illegal logging is one of the prime factors causing deforestation. The economic value of illegal logging around the world (including processing) is estimated between $30 and $100 billion according to the UN Environment Programme. According to WWF, illegal logging happens at a rate of approximately 80 percent in Peru while that in Myanmar is 85 percent and nearly 65 percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition to logging, mining activities have been causing huge damage: approximately 10 percent of the deforestation in Brazilâs Amazon between 2005 and 2015 was due to mining activities. Given the interlinkages and the delicate balance which forests maintain, the fallouts of deforestation are severe. Our forests are called the water fountains as three-quarters of the globeâs accessible freshwater comes from forested watersheds. Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that 40 percent of the worldâs 230 major watersheds have lost more than half of their original tree cover. The Paris Climate Agreement acknowledges the crucial role of forests and trees in maintaining the earthâs temperature. The green lungs absorb (equivalent to) 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. As the second-leading cause of climate change, deforestation accounts for nearly 20 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions â more than the worldâs entire transport sector as per a report by the FAO. This is grave. âAlthough the pace of global deforestation has slowed since the 1990s, it remains high with about 13 million hectares (gross) lost each year. This is partially offset by reforestation, making the total annual net forest cover loss 5.6 million hectaresâ reads a World bank report. Advanced technologies such as AI and big data are being leveraged in the fight against deforestation. SilviaTerra is using AI to monitor forests. SilviaTerra has a software-based approach to solve forest inventory problems by assessing forests using satellite imagery and machine learning. The algorithm, powered by AI, is enabling precision forestry at a fraction of time, fieldwork and cost of conventional methods. SilviaTerra aims to build an up-to-date map of U.S. forests with detailed information about each tree. To do so, they are using Microsoft Azure (MSFT), high-resolution satellite imagery, and U.S. Forest Service inventory and analysis field data to train machine-learning models to measure forests. By analyzing forest sounds, Rainforest Connection (RFCx), a non-government organization âaims to use cell phones to stop deforestation.â The Rainforest Connection (RFCx) has built acoustic monitoring systems to protect a rainforest area by responding to real-time alerts while enhancing protections in these areas. RFCx usesÂ TensorFlow, Googleâs (GOOG, GOOGL) machine learning framework, âto analyze all the auditory data in real-time and listen for chainsaws, logging trucks and other sounds of illegal activity to pinpoint problems in the forest.â 20tree.ai is combining AI and satellite imagery powered by NVIDIAâs (NVDA) computing power to gain information intoÂ forest compositionÂ like tree species, tree height and diameter (DBH), tree growth and productivity. The forest management system by 20tree.ai allows for the monitoring of entire forests in a fraction of the time while providing near real-time intelligence into forest and wood inventory. The system is used by locals, NGOâs, corporates and governments to get actionable insights about deforestation, drought, insect plagues, soil health, storm damage, and other forest disturbances. Overall, advanced technologies such as AI and analytics have made the processing of data (collected through sensors, cameras, satellite images, drones, among other sources) faster, cost-effective, and accurate. Such information is a key to data-driven management for forests and its ecosystem.Â Overall, AI-based solutions are working on the idea of âbetter data, better decisions.""",Prableen Bajpai,"April 12, 2019, 02:06:27 PM EDT",How Big Data Can Help Fight Deforestation,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,1,-1
47," By Michael Amar, Co-organizer of Paris Blockchain Week Summit and Co-founder of Chain Accelerator This year, principal blockchain projects â equipped with heightened mainstream interest â will deploy their infrastructures across the globe and choose a prime location for their European headquarters. But where will they choose: Ireland, Germany, Switzerland? Faced with a continent full of countries that have each embraced blockchain technology, it might seem harder than you think to choose an ideal home for your project. However, amid an increasingly crowded field, one country just got an incredible, â¬500 million headstart: France. In February, Jean-Michel Mis and Laure de La RaudiÃ¨re, members of the French parliament, released a report recommending investments of upwards of â¬500 million in blockchain, outlining 20 different proposals that will help pioneer mass adoption of the technology in the country. With this report, the French government has sent an unequivocal message to the world that France is committed to becoming the next leading blockchain nation. And since then, blockchain projects have responded positively by setting up shop in the worldâs most premiere tourist destination turned technology epicenter. Below, Iâd like to outline a few of the many ways that France is leading the charge for blockchain adoption in Europe, and how its forward-thinking attitude will become a leading example for emerging technologies around the world. Increasing accessibility Blockchain is often compared to the dawn of the internet. In the early 1990s, for example, it would be hard, if not impossible, for even the most ardent supporter of the Macbook to envision what the future of Apple would look like. Whether itâs 1990 or 2090, emerging technologies can be incredibly hard to understand without a foundational background in how they work and why we should use them. Itâs a fact that the French government takes very seriously, which is why it has made a concerted effort to educate the general public on decentralized processes. Franceâs Financia Business School, for instance, recently announced that they will offer post-graduate courses in blockchain and other emerging technologies, serving as a prominent example to other universities about the importance of blockchain education Not only is this significant on its own, but Financia has also decided to allow bitcoin payments for yearly tuition fees. For any technology, mass adoption requires new researchers, developers, institutional consultants, and social enthusiasts â professions that begin at a graduate and postgraduate level. By using higher education to advocate for blockchain technology, France is not only openly advocating for blockchain integration on a mass scale, but itâs also cultivating a pool of top developers to build platforms within the country. Cooperation, not hindrance Blockchain technology rests on 40 years of academic work in mathematics, cryptography, computer science, and telecommunications. However, while its foundation may date back to concepts in the past, its applications are still relatively unknown to government agencies. At least in the near future, it will be increasingly important for government agencies to work with, instead of against, blockchain projects in an effort to remain ahead of an ever changing curve. The fact of the matter is that it will only be a matter of time before blockchain technology permeates every industry and practice area. And the sooner that regulatory bodies realize this, the more prepared they will be to pioneer the digital landscape of the future. Thankfully, equipped with forward-thinking leadership and progressive regulatory policy, France is well on its way to setting the pace for blockchain adoption worldwide. On February 23, French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for the use of blockchain technology to help revitalize supply chain management in the agricultural industry. Macron called upon foreign nations including the United States, China, and Russia to follow Franceâs lead in introducing new and innovative ways to track produce from farm to table. In a statement, Macron said âLetâs do this in Europe, the avant-garde of agricultural technology, by developing tools that will track every product from raw material production to packaging and processing."" Since taking office, Macron has remained vocal about his commitment to emerging technologies, announcing in 2017 that he wanted to make France a startup nation. By setting the stage for innovation, Macron and other French leaders have set an important example for future growth in the country. In sum The world is changing rapidly, even more than we may realize. The innovations of today vary drastically from the innovations of 5, 10, or even 15 years ago. Who knows what the future may hold for blockchain. One of the great beauties of this emerging technology is that its ability to transform our commercial ecosystem bears near limitless potential. However, one thing is for certain, we wonât get anywhere unless we have the support of government agencies looking to see blockchain adoption develop. With France leading the way, I truly believe we will experience the social momentum necessary to bring blockchain to new heights. So the next time someone asks what the great tech epicenters are, youâd be wise to include France in your answer.",Guest Contributors,"April 12, 2019, 09:51:16 AM EDT",How France is Becoming a Blockchain Epicenter in Europe,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,1,1

55,"By Landon Manning Despite a slump in crypto asset prices during the so-called âcrypto winter,â venture capitalists are continuing to pour massive amounts of funding into a variety of blockchain projects. BeInCrypto reported its recent findings on blockchain investment, claiming that venture capitalists have exceeded expectations of investment into distributed ledger technology. Indeed, the site claimed that the first quarter of 2019 has already seen $335 million pouring into various blockchain startups from venture capitalist firms alone. However, the data from 2019 so far has shown that it is unlikely to match 2018 in the total amount of funds raised for blockchain-based enterprises. Last year was a booming one for investment into the blockchain industry, with more than $3 billion raised from venture capital firms. Many of the largest investments went to crypto mining equipment, with Bitmain gathering over $1 billion itself, and smaller players, like Bitfury, still raking in over $80 million. Still, at this rate, 2019 seems well on track to blow 2017 out of the water, showing that the dip in interest caused by the long-term bear market did not eliminate wider interest in the various applications of distributed ledger technology. As BeInCrypto reported, interest in speculation on crypto asset prices has dwindled, and investors now seem more interested in more diverse and longer-term investments. MIT Technology Review also conducted research into this phenomenon, finding that one company has already secured more than $60 million in 2019 venture capital investments. Niraj Pant, a partner at the venture capital firm Polychain Capital, described some of the differences between this slump and previous ones in the greater fintech industry. Pant claimed that in 2015, it âfelt like everything was really dead, and we werenât sure if the market would pick back up. Now it still feels like thereâs still a lot of stuff going on.â Institutional investors, such as hedge funds, are showing increased interest in blockchain startups, which signals a growth in trustworthiness and a sense of broader adoption trends. In addition to supporting a variety of new projects intended to capitalize on the same principles of distributed ledger technology, venture capitalists are also looking toward the possibilities of decentralized finance in the future. âI think we will see blockchains scale in the next few years to allow mainstream consumer applcations [sic] to be built,â Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures wrote on his blog. âBut until then, DeFi [decentralized finance] is a good place to hang out.â",Bitcoin Magazine,"April 10, 2019, 02:59:25 PM EDT",Venture Capitalists Continue Substantial Blockchain Investments,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

60,"A week or so after the Lyft (LYFT) IPO, the popular narrative seems to be that trading has been a bit of a flop, and this has negative implications for other so-called âunicornsâ that are scheduled to go public later this year. The problem with that analysis is that it doesn't quite mesh with reality, and the implications for upcoming IPOs may be different from conventional wisdom. When a company offers shares to the public, the success of the offering to them is not really tied to what happens to the stock in the weeks that follow. The short-term success is measured by the level of pre-IPO demand for shares at the offering price, while the long-term success is only measurable after a year or two as a public company, or at the very least once a couple of earnings reports have been released. What happens in between may not suit some over-enthusiastic traders, but it doesnât reflect on the company, nor the investment bankers who advised them in the run-up to the offering. The job of those bankers is to maximize the returns to the company from the IPO. That is done by drumming up demand, then pricing the shares at the highest possible point while reflecting that demand. From that perspective, Lyftâs launch was a huge success. They priced the shares just above the top end of earlier estimates, resulting in a valuation of $21 billion, yet the initial offering was still over-subscribed. There was even enough residual demand to ensure that the shares initially traded higher, enabling those looking for a quick profit to take one if they chose. As those same investment bankers start to consider pricing for Uber, Pinterest, and other tech unicorns yet to debut, the lesson from all of that is likely to be that growth is still valued. One could argue that because LYFT is now below that $72 mark, it will temper enthusiasm for those future offerings, but history would argue against you. That pattern is not unusual in high-profile IPOs and has little or no bearing on either the long-term future of that stock, nor enthusiasm for upcoming listings. So, if the focus is on growth, what does that mean for the two big unicorns that look to be next in line, Uber and Pinterest? There are questions about the growth of both, but in both cases, there are also answers to those questions. Pinterest saw user growth slow as other social media platforms attacked its format head on, but having survived that, is expected to return to decent user growth soon. There is also lots of room for improvement in the revenue-per-user metrics. Pinterest is currently behind Twitter (TWTR) on that basis, but with them and Facebook (FB) having shown the way to improve monetization, Pinterest has the benefit of a clear road-map. That is why the first pre-IPO analyst's call is bullish. Uber is still growing quickly, but the knock on them is that the rate of growth has apparently slowed a bit recently. That is likely down to two things. First, there is increased competition in the space, not just from Lyft, but also from a whole host of smaller, regional companies around the world. That will inevitably slow growth, but the fact that they are still growing shows the benefit of being the first and best-known in a market. Second, the law of large numbers (in a stock analysis sense) comes into play. Simple logic dictates that it is far easier to achieve, say, forty percent growth on a small number than on a large one. The flip side of that though is that smaller percentage increases in large user numbers result in big increases in overall revenue. There are essentially two types of investor in an IPO, those looking to make a quick buck and those that see long-term potential in the stock. The Lyft offering allowed for the first, and the jury is still out on the second, so those saying that the current price of the stock will have a negative impact on what is to come for Lyft and other unicorn IPOs are mistaken.",Martin Tillier,"April 10, 2019, 10:47:30 AM EDT","LYFT's IPO Has Implications For Other Unicorns, But Not What You Might Think",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,-1,1,-1
61," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) stock has been on a smartphone roller coaster, and that ride has been bumpy lately, with smartphone sales declining while a legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rages on. Diversification into laptop and smartwatch processors has yet to pay off in a meaningful way, but now the company has another play: data centers. Yesterday, QCOM took the wraps off Qualcomm Cloud AI 100, a new processor aimed at data centers where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly important.  At an event on April 9, Qualcomm announced a new processor , targeting a new market for the company. The new Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 is aimed at data centers where AI is critical. The process known as ""AI inferencing"" is where already trained AI puts what it has learned to practical use. For example, AI inference is used to recognize images, to make recommendations to online shoppers or to translate speech into text. Qualcomm's approach is to use its expertise in designing the mobile processors used in smartphones, and apply this approach to AI. Smartphones require significant processing power in a very compact package, and it must be an extremely energy efficient design. The Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 isn't as powerful as the competition's AI inference chips, but it has two key advantages carried over from that smartphone expertise: less heat generated, and much lower power consumption. One of the biggest operational expenses of a datacenter is powering and cooling all the processors inside. That operation is so energy intensive that data centers are predicted to consume 20% of global electricity production by 2025 . QCOM says its Cloud AI 100's low energy requirements offers 10 times the power performance of competing chips. Expected to begin testing later this year with partners including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), they are scheduled to go into production in 2020. Qualcomm says that with its manufacturing capability, it will be able to ramp up output to meet demand very quickly. The datacenter market is a big one, and within that broad category, the datacenter accelerator market - AI inference - was worth an estimated $2.84 billion in 2018. But it's forecast to grow at a CAGR of 49.47% to hit $21.19 billion by 2023 . That's just short of Qualcomm's $22.73 billion in total annual revenue for 2018. The potential payoff for QCOM is big, but so is the competition. The Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 will be going up against established datacenter powerhouses Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). In addition, Reuters points out that tech giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google are making their own AI inference chips . QCOM says it is focusing on the smaller data centers that are proliferating globally as mobile apps and other connected services push for faster response times. These smaller ""edge"" data centers lack the cooling infrastructure needed to power endless racks of Nvidia or Intel chips, they tend to be more cost sensitive and most don't need the same raw computational power a company like Google expects. The Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 with its high performance-per-watt is ideal for these edge data centers. QCOM's focus on the smartphone market took Qualcomm stock to near record heights in 2014, but since then it has been up and down. Currently, QCOM is off those 2014 levels by about 30%, but it has been trending up and InvestorPlace's Chris Tyler wrote it was a buy . That was a day before the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 announcement. Add the company's new push into the lucrative data center market, and QCOM's future is definitely looking rosier. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post How Serious Is Qualcomm's Data Center Play? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

63,"Is it possible that the smartphones that have come to consume our lives are already knocking at the door of oblivion? The CEO of one of the worldâs largest telecoms companies thinks so â¦ Back in the 1970s, when the very first mobile phone wasÂ released, it weighed more than two pounds, was priced at almost $4,000 and took 10 hours to charge, after which one could hold a half-hour conversation before the battery died. Four decades later, and we have the smartphone, and no one can imagine life without themâor without all the bells and whistles, including everything from 3D facial recognition to state-of-the-art cameras. Itâs gone far beyond making phone calls, an act that is going the way of the paper and pen itself. Which brings us to the latest prophetic statement from AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who opined earlier this month that the smartphone is a âcrutchâ that isÂ doomed. Stephensonâs view is that weâre having another 1970s momentâ¦when we realize that what weâve developed is cool, but primitive and just the beginning of something much more sophisticated. And the sophistication comes in the form of â¦ nothing tangible. ""We carry around these devices and they're bigger than they should be... I say they go awayâ¦It is conceivable that we're going to be moving into a world without screens, a world where glasses are your screen,â Stephenson said. According to the AT&T CEO, the advent ofÂ 5G--whose development is so significant that itâs become the stuff ofÂ politicalÂ campaigning--will move all the storage and computing power of mobile phones from the device to the network, rendering the physical phone itself irrelevant. According to a recent EricssonÂ survey, 92 percent of executives from 100 major global telecom operators believe that 5G is the foundation for emerging new technologies not only for smartphones but also for self-driving cars, smart cities â¦ the digital world that is clawing its way to the surface of our reality. What does it mean for phones, exactly? Well, not much in the next few years, at all, as the main carriers in the U.S. are just now in the process of preparing to launch 5G networks. In much of the world, 5G will be released later this year, with aÂ numberÂ of phones unveiled to support the network, including the Huawei Mate X, LG V50 ThinQ, Samsung Galaxy S10 and a handful of others. Apple wasÂ reportedÂ to be sitting out the technology until at least 2020. Coverage will also be limited, and nationwide 5G coverage will take some time with some areas to be included closer to 2024. But as far ahead into the future as we can reasonably see, the sentiment is that smartphones will eventually be replaced by augmented reality glassesâthe apparent elixir to our obsessive phone use (or will it just replace one obsession with another?) A number of big companies and emerging start-ups are alreadyÂ workingÂ in the field of smart and connected glasses, and quite of few are already on the market. They havenât, though, attracted much of a customer base just yet. Take Â Google Glass, for instance, or Microsoftâs HoloLens mixed reality headsets, which put you in touch with your favoriteÂ hologramsÂ but arenât intended for walking around with; rather, they are for professionals taking medical and engineering technology to great new heights.  Google Glass  Microsoft HoloLens 2 The problem is that theyâre not exactly attractive, and vanity still rules the day. Few want to be the lone wearer of large glasses on the street. Until itâs been deemed a fashion fad by a trendy designer, it's probably not going to gain much momentum. But the brains behind the AR glasses know this, and recently theyâve been making moves to team up with fashion companies to come out with something considered actually âwearableâ. In collaboration with one Korean eyewear designer, HuaweiÂ announcedÂ it is entering the smart glasses market by July this year. An Amazon-backed company called North is working on a similar idea with glasses calledÂ Focals,Â which are expected to go on sale by the end of this year. Northâs âFocalsâ  Source: CNBC Some media speculate that evenÂ AppleÂ is preparing to release its augmented reality glasses next year. So, by next year we could already start seeing fewer phones and more âglassesâ on the streets, and from that point, in the whirlwind of technology adoption, itâs probably not far-fetched to say we arenât too many years away from the end of the smartphone.

67," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) revenue is currently dominated by iPhone sales. However, after a decade of massive growth that saw Apple stock hit record highs, that revenue stream is threatened by a softening smartphone market. AAPL has placed an emphasis on services and hardware like wearables to help replace that declining iPhone revenue. A report from analysts at Morgan Stanley suggests a shift to healthcare could actually be the big win for Apple, with the company positioned to disrupt that industry much the way it did with the music and mobile phone markets.  The kicker? Healthcare is a massive industry, worth $3.5 trillion in the U.S. alone. In less than a decade, AAPL could potentially end up with a revenue stream even larger than the iPhone. Imagine what that would do for Apple stock. Morgan Stanley analysts released a report yesterday (via Fortune ) and it's a bombshell for AAPL investors. Worries about declining iPhone revenue have hurt Apple stock and the push to make up for that with services hasn't been entirely smooth sailing, with new initiatives like Apple TV+ video streaming getting a tepid response . Morgan Stanley thinks healthcare could be the true successor to the iPhone. AAPL could leverage its extremely popular wearables - the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless earbuds - by adding more medical-grade technology. For example, adapting the AirPods to be hearing aides, or adding blood pressure monitoring capability to the Apple Watch. The hardware is just part of a growing health ecosystem Apple has developed, including the iOS Health App, and ReasearchKit, which was used by a recent Stanford study that tracked heart data for over 400,000 Apple Watch users . The company also has a $245 billion in cash on hand, which could be used to purchase a healthcare company or technology. The final piece of the puzzle is Apple's reputation for privacy protection, something other tech companies eyeing the healthcare market like Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) currently lack. According to the Morgan Stanley team, a successful Apple disruption of the healthcare market could pay off with anywhere from $15 billion to as much as $313 billion in new revenue by 2027. At the upper end that would not only dwarf the money AAPL makes from iPhone sales, healthcare revenue alone would eclipse the company's $265.5 billion total annual revenue for 2018. That is some serious upside for Apple stock. The idea that AAPL could monetize its growing forays into healthcare isn't new. The catalyst has been the Apple Watch. Since its introduction in 2015, AAPL has shifted the focus of the Apple Watch from being a ""computer on your wrist"" smartwatch to being a health and fitness wearable.  The latest version of the device includes integrated ECG test capability Â and fall detection. Apple has been talking to Medicare providers about subsidizing the Apple Watch for seniors . In 2017, Apple acquired sleep tracking company Beddit , although it has yet to integrate that technology into the Apple Watch. The company has also hired teams of healthcare professionals as it seeks ways to boost Apple Watch adoption through features like an integrated blood glucose sensor for diabetics . The Apple Watch has become a key part of the company's push into healthcare. Morgan Stanley is suggesting the company has the pieces in place to leverage not just the Apple Watch, but also its relationship with medical researchers, its reputation for privacy protection - and its deep pockets - to make a move that could disrupt healthcare. The idea of AAPL pivoting to become a company where healthcare is a big source of revenue - if not its primary source of revenue - may seem farfetched. But the company has reinvented itself multiple times already. In the 1990s when it was a struggling computer company, few foresaw a time when Apple would disrupt the global music industry and transform into an electronics company with iTunes and the iPod. And even at the iPod's pinnacle, not many people would have pictured a company where smartphones accounted for over 60% of the company's revenue, driving Apple stock to the point of a trillion dollar market cap. Services are a big part of AAPL's future, but if the cards fall into place, healthcare could be the next big driver of Apple revenue - and it could make the iPhone era look like small potatoes in comparison. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post Why Healthcare Could Be the Next Big Thing for Apple Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .

78," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The relationship between Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has deteriorated in recent months. In the latest example of the growing animosity between the two, with no warning, Netflix AirPlay support has abruptly ended. Apple recently inked high profile deals with number of TV manufacturers to include AirPlay 2 support - a big deal, given the feature has previously required an Apple TV streamer to work - but with the Netflix move, Apple device users can no longer stream Netflix to those TVs. In fact, they can no longer stream Netflix content to an Apple TV eitherâ¦  The move is more of a nuisance than anything for most users, but it serves notice that AAPL is facing a battle as it pivots to services in an attempt to wean revenue reliance and Apple stock value off iPhone sales. On Friday, owners of Apple devices noticed that when they tried to cast Netflix content from their iPhone or iPad, it failed . Netflix AirPlay support has been available on these devices since 2013, so that was definitely odd. Netflix quietly added a note to its mobile devices support page , stating, ""Airplay is no longer supported for use with Netflix due to technical limitations."" Further investigation showed that not only had Netflix AirPlay support stopped working with TVs that support AirPlay, but it had also been shut down with the Apple TV set-top streamer. As new of the Netflix move began to make headlines, the company issued a statement explaining its actions (via MacRumors ): ""We want to make sure our members have a great Netflix experience on any device they use. With AirPlay support rolling out to third-party devices, there isn't a way for us to distinguish between devices (what is an Apple TV vs. what isn't) or certify these experiences. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue Netflix AirPlay support to ensure our standard of quality for viewing is being met. Members can continue to access Netflix on the built-in app across Apple TV and other devices."" It's not clear what viewing quality optimization Netflix might have been implementing, but the fact the company also shut down AirPlay support for the Apple TV suggests there might be a little more to the move.  For most iPhone and iPad users, the Netflix move shouldn't be a big deal. The native Netflix app on the Apple TV still works. Anyone who bought a new Samsung TV when it was announced as the first brand to get built-in AirPlay 2 support won't be able to cast Netflix from an iOS app, but smart TVs all have built-in Netflix support these days. The Netflix move largely means inconvenience. Killing Netflix AirPlay support forces people to sign into TVs with their Netflix account instead of casting content to the TV with their iPhone. The NFLX action takes some of the wind out of Apple's move to bring AirPlay 2 support to a wide range of TVs . This was a big deal because for more than a decade AAPL has forced consumers to buy an Apple TV streamer if they wanted to cast content from their iPhone or iPad to a TV. And that move ties into a critical strategy: pump up services like the new Apple TV+ streaming video service . With iPhone sales down, boost revenue and keep Apple stock value growing by rapidly growing Services division revenue. Faced with revenue pressures of its own, NFLX has increasingly railed against Apple's efforts, from refusing to let iPhone users pay for a Netflix subscription through an app (thereby avoiding Apple's 30% cut) to refusing to participate in AAPL's streaming video service plans . Netflix told The Verge the move was "" not a business competition play "" but the timing is suspicious. As Apple's services move and Apple TV+ bring it closer to being an actual competitor for subscribers, the yanking of Netflix AirPlay support is just the latest move by NFLX that make things a little for difficult for Apple - intentionally or not. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post Netflix Kills AirPlay Support, Bruising Apple's TV Ambitions appeared first on InvestorPlace .

79,"Shutterstock photo With an estimated $245 billion in cash on the balance sheet and another $76 billion in operating cash flow, there's not much Apple (AAPL) can't buy. Apple's cash alone, in fact, would rank it in the top ten of the most valuable companies in the S&P 500 index. In the companyâs pursuit for growth in its services business, there are several M&A targets the iPhone maker should consider. We already know the company has had ambitions of making a splash in media business. Time Warner was once believed to be in Apple's crosshairs, according to the Financial Times. Citing three people who were briefed on the possible M&A interest, the FT reported a top Apple executive raised the prospect of buying Time Warner at a recent meeting. With talks yielding no agreement, AT&T (T) swooped in and closed the deal. ""We would definitely buy something larger than we bought thus far,"" CEO Tim Cook has been quoted as saying to years ago. Cook qualified his statement by saying any deal Apple considers would have to fit strategically with the companyâs business from the standpoint of âgreat technology and great people.â Itâs for this reason I believe Apple should go after streaming a company like Netflix (NFLX) â an argument Iâve raised on more than one occasion. This deal would make sense on many levels, namely from the fact that Apple is hungry for content partnerships. The company is fresh from unveiling its own standalone streaming video content service. Appleâs transition into a fully-fledged services company has been ramped up. And Netflix would make it easier for Apple to offer a wide range of content to consumers. The company's premium streaming video service called Apple TV+ is perceive as an attack on Netflix. But it doesnât have to be. Netflix is here to stay. Appleâs entry served to confirm what a great business model Netflix has. Instead of competing with Netflix, Apple could quickly emerge as the worldâs largest movie streaming service by acquiring Netflix. That said, with Netflixâs market cap at about $160 billion, on top of the premium Apple would pay for Netflix, this deal would not come cheap. Apple, which is not known for making big M&A deals, could spend $195 billion for Netflix, which includes a 21% premium and seal the deal. To date, the companyâs biggest acquisition has been the $3.1 billion it paid for Beats Electronics in 2014. But while organic growth has been its main strategy, the fact that the companyâs bread-and-butter iPhone business has begun to slow could (or should) spark a change in its approach to M&A. The other name Apple could consider is Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Appleâs recent unveiling of a gaming platform underscores the companyâs interest in taking a bite out of the $140 billion gaming industry. Dubbed Apple Arcade, the service, which will allow gamers to start a game on one Apple device and continue it on another, will be subscription-based and will feature 100 new games exclusive solely to Apple. Acquiring Activision, a leader not only in gaming but also in esports, makes tons of sense for Apple. Even with a market cap of $36 billion, Apple wouldnât have to spend its cash pile as it could buy Activision two times with just its cash flow alone. But while these deals make sense on many levels, will Apple, which has seen its stock fall 14% in the past six months, finally do what many investors have begged for over the years: make a big M&A splash?",Richard Saintvilus,"April 08, 2019, 09:27:30 AM EDT",Should Apple (AAPL) Pivot From Its M&A Strategy?,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,-1,1,-1
